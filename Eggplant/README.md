Eggplant parmesan or _parmigiana di melanzane_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features‚Äîfar from straightforward. Where this recipe originated seems to be in its name. "Parmigiana" points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there is only a finishing touch of this dish, not a main ingredient. Instead, some food historians locate the birthplace of parmigiana in regions in southern Italy. The writer [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that written records strongly indicate Naples as the origin of the dish. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that "parmigiana" might be a mispronunciation of "palmigiana," a Sicilian word for "shutters" and perhaps a metaphor for the louvred construction of the dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Others claim "parmigiana" might be a Sicilian word for ‚ÄúPersian,‚Äù _parmiciana_, and a reference to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Though unsubstantiated, this last theory gestures to a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and plants rarely stay put in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

Eggplant (_Solanum melongena_) is a culinary vegetable, but in botanical terms, it is a fruit, a berry since it contains small, edible seeds. Smooth, glossy, and often colorful, it resembles a fruit on the surface. Inside, however, its flesh is spongy, astringent, and occasionally bitter. Ambiguity also characterizes eggplant‚Äôs winding journey to kitchens across the globe. Start to dig into this history, and the eggplant recedes into obscurity, where it long remained before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. In these regions today, people likely know of this nightshade and may have even let it pass their lips, as global cuisine abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include Eastern Mediterranean or Levantine cuisine including moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous. Other recipes include _Mchuzi wa Biringani_  ([Tanzanian eggplant curry](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/)), Indian Punjab _baingan bartha_ (mashed eggplant), Chinese Sichuan _yuxiang qiezi_ (fish-fragrant eggplant), and countless other Asian preparations. But compared to its New World counterparts in the Solanaceae family, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of diners‚Äô familiarity‚Äîunless of course their background is among the cultures who cultivated a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

### Cultivars

As a popular vegetable in many parts of the world, eggplant now has dozens of edible varieties and cultivars,* partly thanks to the fact that, with or without human intervention, this genus hybridizes easily.* Genetic analyses show that characteristics like size, shape, and taste were decisive in the eggplant's domestication, which began in Asia over 2,000 years ago. According to the botanists Jin-Xiu Wang, Tian-Gang Gao, and Sandra Knapp, "these traits were actively and gradually selected; fruit size changed from small to large, taste changed from not palatable to what was termed at the time sweetish, and that over time, a wider variety of fruit shapes was cultivated."*** All over the world, horticulturists, gardeners, and cooks get excited when talking about eggplant cultivars, highlighting their taste and texture. The Japanese Pickling is described as "sweet and mellow tasting with creamy, meaty flesh."* Eggplants are also admired for their ornamental attributes, like the eye-catching white and purple Italian Rosa Bianca, the tiny watermelon-like Thai eggplant, or the beloved Old White Egg, possibly the first type of eggplant to reach England in the sixteenth century. Certain cultivars reveal their growers' fertile imaginations by the names that they coin: the miniature Fairy Tale, so called perhaps for its lovely violet skin with white stripes, the prolific Little Fingers, a petite, glossy, dark purple Japanese cultivar, which grows in clusters of 20 fruits or more, the big Black Beauty, oval, shiny, and jet-black like Anna Sewell's famous horse, and the slim hybrid named Ichiban, meaning "best" in Japanese. Eggplants' coloring and patterning are clearly valued almost as much as their flavor, and though the ubiquitous eggplant emoji is solid purple, eggplants can be white, green, yellow, red, reddish-purple, light purple, dark purple, black, or even more than one color, as with the striped or "marbled" varieties.

### Sexualization of eggplant

In North America, eggplant might be more readily recognized as a sexual organ than as a food. In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the [eggplant emoji](https://emojipedia.org/eggplant/) as part of the keyboard of icons that now serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media. ‚ÄúAubergine‚Äù is the name for the eggplant emoji in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic visual display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was included in Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users outside of Japan.* In no time at all, the eggplant emoticon became code for an erect penis. On September 30, 2011, the first known use of the emoji as a phallic symbol appeared on Twitter, when @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted: im jelly no üçÜ üò•.* Now, for anyone the least bit tech-savvy in the US and Canada, the elongated, purple fruit with a bulbous end is synonymous with cell phone foreplay, or ‚Äúsexting.‚Äù

The digital age is just the latest chapter of the eggplant‚Äôs erotic entanglements. Written in Sanskrit roughly 2,000 years ago, the _Kama Sutra_ touts this nightshade as a libido booster. This ancient Indian self-help guide recommends rubbing the male member, or ‚Äúlingam,‚Äù with eggplant to produce ‚Äúa swelling lasting for one month.‚Äù* As questionable as it sounds, this claim is not too off the mark. [Recent](https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/mediterranean-diet-shows-promise-in-men-with-erectile-dysfunction) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893753/) have shown that eating more eggplant can reduce hypertension, a major cause of [erectile dysfunction.](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/high-blood-pressure-erectile-dysfunction) Around the time that the _Kama Sutra_ was written, practitioners of Ayurveda, a classical system of Indian medicine, knew about the many health benefits of certain wild relatives of the eggplant, species still found in pharmacopeias today.* Among the world‚Äôs earliest records of eggplant are foundational Ayurvedic texts like the _Charaka Samhita_ and _Sushruta Samhita_.* Written a millennium later, in the eleventh century, the _Taqwim al-Sihhah_ (_The Maintenance of Health_) by the Arab physician Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn of Baghdad features eggplant again in a sexual context. Translated into Latin and illustrated in Italy as the _Tacuinum Sanitatis_, this medical treatise includes versions depicting a woman and a man loitering by an oversized eggplant bush. Under the spell of the risqu√© fruit, they engage in a triste to the dismay of another woman who has happened upon them.

_Gastronomica_ writer John Varriano notes the sexual innuendo of food and botanical imagery in painting and poetry of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. In Varriano‚Äôs chronology, eggplant might have first been visually equated with reproductive organs at the Villa Farnesina in Rome.* During 1517‚Äì1518, the artist Raphael decorated the loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche, and surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> penetrating a burst fig, and in this case, a pair of eggplants stand in for testicles. Varriano explains that behind this kind of visual ribaldry was the ‚Äúdoctrine of signatures,‚Äù the speculation that similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence.* An example is eating walnuts for mental power since the folds and craters of these large seeds recall a brain. At the time, scholars like the Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta maintained that it was by God‚Äôs design that certain plants resembled the body parts of humans or animals. For example, Porta‚Äôs _Phytognomica_, published in 1588, includes an [illustration](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rr67jxat/images?id=pj99fsjc) comparing plant roots to dog genitalia.

### Art and vegetables in the Renaissance

### World distribution

Eggplant is now commercially a global plant, but the vast majority of eggplant production takes place in Bangladesh, India, and China where it is a staple food in a way that it isn't in Western Europe or North America. 

World distribution (historical? production? concentration of species?) Production, trade networks, etymology, genetics. Include: Growing information around the world. Culture: perennial in the tropics, annual in more temperate zones, growing zone # range, soil, ideal temperature, pests, diseases, seed saving, companion plants. Emphasize here or in the conclusion how eggplant is well-suited to hot climates, a growing concern with climate change.

### Europe and Western 'interest' and 'ignorance' about the plant
Cultural responses to eggplant in Early Modern Europe were largely dependent on the connection from which eggplant encounters came. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the eggplant cultures of India and China, with Iberic and Italian food culture influenced by Islamic and Jewish Mediterranean connections, and English botanists only finding eggplant through their European neighbours. The Hortus Malabaricus is a key exception, as a locally informed document of India‚Äôs south western coast, but that is more about potentially useful information than cultural connection.

Mattioli in 16th century Italy, largely quoting from the scholar Hermolaos Barbarus writes about how it was ‚Äògenerally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms‚Äô and adds that ‚Äòthere are some of our people who feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love‚Äô. However, he adds that they are hard to digest and create a number of digestive sicknesses and long-lasting illnesses. The new-world tomato and the mythical ‚Äòpomi d‚Äôoro‚Äô or golden apple are conflated as varieties of Melanzana which seems to have caused this image (from bessler) which cites Mattioli, to have been painted in golden after publication. 16th century Spain and Italy had key connections with the Islamic world in both trade and warfare in a similar way, and thus a third degree connection to the eggplant through Islamic and Jewish food culture. A benefit here is that as south as the Swiss border there appears to be no problem in growing the plant, as Fuchs describes them as ‚Äòsown in our gardens, but frequently in ‚Ä¶ hanging window gardens‚Äô with cucumbers and melons. Fuchs‚Äô german botanical tradition owed much to Swiss and Italian scholarship, and his warmer climate in T√ºbingen connected him to this botanical culture. Northern Mediterranean eggplant encounters involved some suspicion but were dictated mostly by shared food culture. Fuchs writes, amused, that some people ‚Äòimmediately avoid the use of them, terrified by the name itself‚Äô to suggest that suspicion of the eggplant is greatly exaggerated. English herbals, one more step removed than Italian and Spanish cultural encounters, were deeply suspicious of eggplant. Gerarde‚Äôs highly successful 1597 Herball (and Thomas Johnson‚Äôs popular 1633 edition) writes that he saw only one fruit ‚Äòof the bigness of a goose egg one extraordinary temperate year‚Äô in a merchant‚Äôs garden. He contended that ‚Äòthe people of Toledo do eat them with great devotion‚Äô but ‚Äòi rather with English men to content themselves with the meat and sauce of our own country‚Äô because ‚Äòthese apples have a mischievous quality, the use whereof is utterly to be forsaken‚Äô. Gerarde recommends ‚Äòto esteem this plant and have him in the garden for your pleasure‚Äô. The idea of english people and english plants being suited naturally to each other, coupled with an inability to grow eggplant locally gave it a suspicious quality which remained remarkably persistant over time. Morison's 1699 Herball desctibes them as 'condemned by doctors as harmful and perverse'.  Much of Gerarde's advice was copied straight into Miller‚Äôs famous Gardeners‚Äô dictionary of 1754 which contends that ‚Äòthese plants are only preserved as curiosities in the english gardens‚Äô and only eaten by ‚Äòsome italians or spaniards‚Äô. The concept of exotic plants and native goodness is important here, as we see both culinary suspicion and aesthetic admiration of plants which are several steps culturally removed from our authors.

The 1678 Hortus Malabaricus shows how this conceptual model informed the first hand encounters of dutch imperialists with their local contacts. Van Rheede, the governor of Dutch Malabar was informed by a distinguished local herbalist called Itty Achudan on plant use. Thus, the first name recorded is the ‚Äòbraman name‚Ä¶ Vaenna‚Äô, and information that ‚Äòthe juice relieves cows from internal abscesses and that the fruit was used to cure toothaches is not recorded in any of the european herbals mentioned above. Rheede appears to lament directly that ‚Äòthe fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but india produces edible nightshades!‚Äô. Thus, the eggplant is tied into a Western botanical framework as a miraculous product of far-away lands.

### Eggplant in Western and Eastern Asia

Fuchs references a writer called ‚ÄòAvicenna‚Äô, better known as the persian physician Ibn Sina as a source of information on the eggplant, attributing the origin of much of his knowledge to the medical culture of the medieval Islamic caliphate. Islamic trade networks connected the territory of the early caliphates in the Middle East with the riches of East Africa and India, and brought eggplant organically into their food culture. The plant is ‚Äòmentioned many times‚Äô in the Ibn Wahshiyya‚Äôs Book of Nabatean agriculture‚Äô which aimed to record the ancient wisdom of persia‚Äôs pre-islamic cultures and in turn attribute eggplant culture to those peoples. This suggests that it was Persian culture which received the eggplant from India, and the conquests of the early caliphate that brought it round the southern side of the Mediterranean. Stories around the glorious wedding feast of Al-Mamun to Buran in 852 include a story of the introduction of the eggplant as a luxury dish to the Arab elite. This has been passed down into food culture as a wide variety of derivative eggplant dishes with names like Burani or Buraniyya. A Cordoban calendar of the 10th century mentions the plant and Wahshiyya mentions six varieties including a specific Cordovan variety. The emirate of Cordova in the 10th century was a rebel caliphate in the south of modern-day spain and from this connection, eggplant became part of Iberian food culture. The eggplant was absorbed from India into Persia and into Islamic elite culture as a luxury dish, which found its way across the Mediterranean via Jewish and Islamic cultural movement to Italy and Iberia and then through them into Northern Europe. Nonetheless, Eggplant travelled relatively light, and much of the ancient culture around eggplant in China, Japan and India did not come with it.

Art and literature attest to a profound human relationship with the eggplant in China, where this crop was cultivated no later than 59 BCE.^ We know this, explain the botanists Wang, Gao, and Knapp in their 2008 study "Ancient Chinese Literature Reveals Pathways of Eggplant Domestication," because this is the year of the first known written Chinese record of eggplant. In this text, _Tong Yue_ ("The Slave's Contract"), the poet Wang Bao advises transplanting eggplant seedlings during the spring equinox, advice that still stands for this frost-intolerant plant.^ His reference corresponds chronologically with the sowing of domesticated eggplant in the alluvial soils of southwestern China.^ Consulting 76 books in all, Wang, Gao, and Knapp track how Chinese farmers over time bred eggplants to be larger, longer, sweeter, and less bitter and spiny.^ For example, in the sixth century, a text states that the fruits were generally only pellet-sized, but a record made 600 years later reports that eggplants had become more the size of teacups.^ According to Wang, Gao, and Knapp, the [earliest known Chinese illustration of eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-2-uid-1) (1061 CE) is a print in the _Tu Jing Bencao_ or _Bencao Tujing_ (‚ÄúIllustrated Classic of Materia Medica‚Äù) by Su Song of the Northern Song Dynasty. In another materia medica written around 200 years later, the _L√º Chanyan Bencao_ (‚ÄúThe Cliff Walker's Materia Medica‚Äù), the botanists find a [vividly painted eggplant.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-3-uid-2) Not only verdant, this eggplant is also naturally proportioned, because the artist Wang Jie used single perspective, which he adopted from Southern Song landscape painting.## A somewhat later illustration of eggplant appears in the _Yinshan Zhengyao_ (‚ÄúDietary Principles‚Äù) by Hu Sihui, a Yuan Dynasty dietician of the Mongol emperor.+ Completed in 1330, this treatise outlines food safety and lists several recipes, including stuffed eggplant, a dish that reveals China's longstanding Turkish presence.+ Out of the collapse of the Yuan dynasty arose the imperial Ming Dynasty. During this dyansty's centuries-long reign, foreign trade expanded, as China came into greater contact with outside cultures. The influence of Europe can be detected in the realism with which a pair of deep purple eggplants are rendered in a Ming-era still life of vegetables and fruit held by the British Museum.

The importance of eggplant to China‚Äôs neighbors can also be gleaned from their artistic and literary traditions. A Korean artist of the Joseon Dynasty, Shin Saimdang (1504‚Äì1551), mother of the Confucian scholar and politician Yi I, included eggplant among still life paintings on an eight-panel screen. These delicate compositions represent _Chochungdo_ (‚Äúinsects on flowers‚Äù), a genre developed by Shin Saimdang, who emphasized careful observation of Korean flora and fauna.^ Among sites of eggplant cultivation, northern Vietnam is included in what some believe to be China‚Äôs earliest botanical treatise, the fourth-century _Nanfang Caomu Zhuang_ (‚ÄúPlants of the Southern Regions‚Äù) by Ji Han. The ancient Vietnamese trading port of H·ªôi An was the site where an early sixteenth-century [water dropper](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_2001-1129-5_1) in the shape of an upright eggplant was excavated. During the eighth century, eggplant reached Japan from China.* The agricultural text _Seikei zusetsu_, compiled in southern Japan around the beginning of the nineteenth century, features a sumptuous print of eggplant described as ‚ÄúBohai,‚Äù possibly indicating its Chinese origins. As revealed by the hybrid style of this imagery, this encyclopedic project was the outcome of nearly two centuries of exchange between Japanese and European scholarship through the presence of the Dutch East India Company in Nagasaki.

### Atlantic exchanges

### The expanding cultures of eggplant: agriculture 

US and eggplant. Not until the nineteenth century did Northern Americans begin to significantly incoporate eggplant into their diet. Then its incorporation in horticulture, appearance of eggplant in growing guides, seed catalogs: rustic context. Measuring tapes and agricultural competitions. Normalization and naturalization. 

### The expanding cultures of eggplant: art

Agricultural expansion of eggplant culture, and its normalization as food in Northern Europe and North America since the 19th century, were accompanied by a promotion of this vegetable as an artistic subject, demonstrating how art and food are intimately related even in highly industrialized and urbanized societies. This includes examples of eggplant representations in the applied arts, such as the 20th century Portuguese Majolica ceramic teapot -- eggplant-shaped in purple and green (a very different form of representation in comparison to oriental vegetable-inspired objects, which usually reach a higher level of refinement and abstraction in relation to the imitated object). Another example is the leaded glass screen created by the North-American company Tiffany & Co. Their designs were very much in fashion around 1870-1890, and, as in other Art Nouveau creations, valued natural elements as a source of inspiration, creating elaborate patterns like the one in the panel, where a trellis provides the support for an eggplant bush with multicolored leaves and deep black fruit.

Avant-garde European painting also reveals the eggplant's expanding cultural meaning and its normalization as an household object -- as Paul C√©zanne's _Still Life with a Ginger Jar and Eggplants_ (1893-94) and Henri Matisse's _Still Life with Aubergines_ (1911) demonstrate. In Matisse's painting, however, the three small purple eggplants represent much more than cooking ingredients; "balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape"*, they seem to be the visual starting point of a decorative explosion of textures and colors that spread throughout the environment and even beyond it (as the mirror, the window with the landscape beyond, and the open back door show). This painting reveals one of Matisse's fundamental themes: the conversion of his own studio into a imaginary space, permeated by the _joie de vivre_ (joy of life); in this very personal recreation of the garden of paradise, the painter's great admiration for Persian miniatures and Oriental art emerge; and eggplants, without losing their domestic character, are reconnected to their origins, beyond the Mediterranean, in the remote Arabias or in the Far East.

Decades later, North-American photographers further explored the formal properties of the fruit, its shape, color and texture. Throught abstraction and a highly refined sense of composition and light, Edward Weston (1886-1958) depicts, in _Eggplant_ (1930) a dark globular cultivar -- the same variety of US' agricultural manuals of the end of the 19th century. As in many of his works, here he unveils the unexpected and the marvellous of natural elements and everyday objects, and their connections with the human body**. Although the reference to the dietary significance of the eggplant is still present (as the white plate proves),  the shiny ridged vegetable awakens also an aesthetical visual approach, and the urge to actually touch it and feel the smoothness of the skin, the firmness of the flesh. 

This visual but also sensual sense gains strength in the work of Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-1989), whose style, according to Levinson***, is derived from that of Weston, in its creative use of light and formal experimentation. Mapplethorpe produced hundreds of nude studies and impactful erotic photographs. Eroticism is, in fact, the guiding thread of his gaze****, permeating his portraits of women, men, flowers and fruit, including a sensuous bunch of grapes and the famous _Eggplant_ (1985) portrait. Here, a single vegetable lies alone in an unindentified space, whose neutrality is broken by the striped shade of a blind. The meaty eggplant turns into a body or a body part, marked by sun and shade; its nutritional meaning seems to be lost, and, as an object of desire, the eggplant can only be eaten with lust and concupiscence, in yet another example of the sexualization of this vegetable -- and maybe of its commodification in hyper-consumerist societies. Its curves and crevices stretch our imagination and ressemble the curves and crevices of the equally appalling torso of _Thomas (Back)_ (1986), a black male model favored by the artist and depicted in a similar studio setting.

### New eggplants, old issues: BT-Brinjal and globalisation
Following the eggplant through global history shows the way plant meaning has been, and continues to be created through the interactions between cultural structures and the individuals who worked within and between them. What was an ancient and storied plant in India and China became a similarly richly appreciated plant in persian and in early islamic food culture. Through Mediterranean exchange in the early modern period, jewish and muslim communities brought eggplant into popularity in Iberia and Italy, and then by extension to an English botanical community primarily interested in its exotic, rather than culinary appeal. From Europe, the eggplant was carried through the networks of empire into the modern global food trade. In recent years it has become one the center of one of the hardest fought Genetically Modified crop issues as varieties of 'BT brinjal' endorsed by Cornell University designed to withstand pests and drastically reduce farmers' need to spray pesticide on their crops have been made illegal in India and the Phillippines but are cultivated in Bangladesh. The idea after thousands of years of and American institution sending the eggplant back in a changed form is a strange one, and this context is key to the kind of issues plant humanities deals with. The plant is not just a bare, lab grown improvement but a vessel full of cultural meaning. People question why an ancient 'indigenous' plant should need genetic modification and worry about the implications of meddling with ecological heritage. On the other hand, there is real chance through GM crops to improve people's lives and genetic engineering does not necessarily have to be so set against cultural heritage. If one thing is clear from the history of the eggplant, it is that human culture around food, medicine and ecology weaves complex, fluid meaning around the plants by which we live in ways that are powerful and important, but nevertheless fickle and difficult to pin down.
