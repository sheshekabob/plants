Eggplant parmesan or parmigiana di melanzane is like the culinary vegetable that it features—not so straightforward. The origin of this Mediterranean dish appears to be in the name. Parmigiano alludes to Parma in northern Italy and the cheese produced there, right? Some note, however, that parmigiana sounds like palmigiana, a Sicilian word for “shutters,” which might be a metaphor for the louvred construction of this dish: fried eggplant rounds are tucked between layers of tomato sauce and mozzarella, before dusting with a hard Italian cheese and baked. In fact, Sicily and the Campania and Calabria regions in southern Italy are most often credited as the birthplace of parmigiana. But food historians juggle other theories. A writer on Mediterranean cuisine, Clifford Wright believes that written records tell us Naples originated the dish as it is now known. According to an unsubstantiated, but intriguing claim, another related Sicilian word, parmiciana meaning “Persian,” refers to the culture that helped introduce the eggplant to Europe.

Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.
