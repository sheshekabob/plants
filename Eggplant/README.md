Eggplant parmesan or _parmigiana di melanzane_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features—far from straightforward. The origin of this Mediterranean dish seems to be in the name. Many assume that "Parmigiano" alludes to Parma in northern Italy and the hard Italian cheese produced there. However, that parmesan is _not_ a main ingredient of eggplant parmigiana suggests other possibilities. The food writer Clifford Wright argues that records clearly indicate Naples as the origin of the dish. Some locate the birthplace in other regions of southern Italy as well as in Sicily. "Parmigiana" might be a mispronunciation of _palmigiana_, a Sicilian word for shutters. This is perhaps a metaphor for the louvred construction of this dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Another claim suggests "parmigiana" might really be the Sicilian word for Persian, _parmiciana_, and possibly a reference to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe. Albeit unsubstantiated, this last theory hints at a truth greater than the fact of who did what where first. Like food and culture, plants are rarely content to stay put; they prefer to move and mingle.

Smooth, glossy, and ranging in color from midnight black to deep purple to eggshell white, eggplant resembles the fruit that it technically is—on the surface. Inside, its flesh is spongy, astringent, and occasionally bitter and seedy, and it quickly turns brown from oxidization. Cooking eggplant teases out its flavors and alchemizes its texture from a dry sponge to creamy silk. It can be sautéed, fried, steamed, boiled, broiled, stewed, roasted, grilled, smoked, pickled, or thrown into a countertop cooker. Conventional wisdom dictates first salting eggplant to make it less bitter, but today’s crops have been bred to be much less so. The bitterness is a plant defense: solanine, an alkaloid poisonous only in vast quantities. As part of the Solanaceae family, eggplant has never completely shaken the nightshade stigma, despite that fact that global cuisine abounds with eggplant dishes, and with just an Internet browser, home chefs can find a diversity of recipes. A few favorites include Levantine or Eastern Mediterranean classics like moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous, Mchuzi wa Biringani (Tanzanian eggplant curry),* Chinese Sichuan yúxiāng qiézì (fish-fragrant eggplant), and an infinitesimal number of other Asian preparations. The ambiguity of eggplant foreshadows its long journey to kitchens across the globe. Start digging into its history, and the eggplant quickly fades from view, where it remained for millennia before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. Today, the majority of people in these regions know of eggplant, and may have even had it pass their lips as a pizza topping, or in a casserole, sandwich, stir-fry, curry, stew, or dip. But compared to other nightshades like tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of the diner’s familiarity—unless of course their background is included in the cultures who forged a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.
