Eggplant parmesan, _parmigiana di melanzane_, or simply _parmigiana_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features—far from straightforward. Where this dish originated seems to be in its name. _Parmigiana_ points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there is only a finishing touch, not a main ingredient. Instead, many credit regions in southern Italy as the birthplace of parmigiana. The food writer [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that records cleary indicate Naples as the origin of the dish as we know it today. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that "parmigiana" might be "palmigiana" mispronounced. This Sicilian word for "shutters" is perhaps a metaphor for the louvred construction of the dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Others claim "parmigiana" might be a Sicilian word for “Persian,” _parmiciana_, and a reference to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Albeit unsubstantiated, this last theory hints at a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and plants rarely stay put in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

Eggplant is a culinary vegetable, but in botanical terms, it is a fruit, a berry in fact, since it contains small, edible seeds. Smooth, glossy, and often colorful, it resembles a fruit on the surface. Inside, however, its flesh is spongy, astringent, and sometimes bitter. This ambiguity also defines eggplant’s winding journey to kitchens across the globe. Start to dig into this history, and the eggplant quickly recedes into obscurity, where it long remained before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. In these regions today, people likely know of this nightshade, and may have even let it pass their lips, as global cuisine abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include Eastern Mediterranean or Levantine cuisine like moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous; _Mchuzi wa Biringani_ or [Tanzanian eggplant curry](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/); Indian Punjab baingan bartha or mashed eggplant; Chinese Sichuan _yuxiang qiezi_ or fish-fragrant eggplant; and an infinitesimal number of other Asian preparations. But compared to its relatives in the Solanaceae family, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of diners’ familiarity—unless of course their background is included in the cultures who forged a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

# Europe and Western 'interest' and 'ignorance' about the plant

Cultural responses to eggplant in Early Modern Europe were largely dependent on the connection from which eggplant encounters came. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the eggplant cultures of India and China, with Iberic and Italian food culture influenced by Islamic and Jewish Mediterranean connections, and English botanists only finding eggplant through their European neighbours. The Hortus Malabaricus is a key exception, as a locally informed document of India’s south western coast, but that is more about potentially useful information than cultural connection.

Then its incorporation in horticulture, appearance of eggplant in growing guides, seed catalogs: rustic context. Measuring tapes and agricultural competitions. Normalization and naturalization.
