Dredged in flour, fried, smothered in tomato sauce, blanketed in mozzarella, sprinkled with a hard Italian cheese, and baked until golden and crisp. Eggplant parmesan—or parmigiana in homage to its Mediterranean roots—is a surefire way to secret a culinary vegetable onto the plate of a child or a picky eater. In botanical terms, the eggplant is a fruit, a berry in fact, since it contains small, edible seeds. The ambiguity of eggplant foreshadows its long journey to kitchens across the globe. Start digging into the history of this culinary vegetable / fruit / berry / whatsit, and the eggplant quickly fades from view, where it remained for millennia before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. Today, the majority of people in these regions know of eggplant, and may have even had it pass their lips as a pizza topping, or in a casserole, sandwich, stir-fry, curry, stew, or dip. But compared to other nightshades like tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of the diner’s familiarity—unless of course their background is included in the cultures who forged a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.
