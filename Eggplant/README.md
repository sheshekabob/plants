Eggplant parmesan, _parmigiana di melanzane_, or simply _parmigiana_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features‚Äîfar from straightforward. Where this dish originated seems to be in its name. _Parmigiana_ points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there is only a finishing touch, not a main ingredient. Instead, many credit regions in southern Italy as the birthplace of parmigiana. The food writer [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that records cleary indicate Naples as the origin of the dish as we know it today. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that "parmigiana" might be "palmigiana" mispronounced. This Sicilian word for "shutters" is perhaps a metaphor for the louvred construction of the dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Others claim "parmigiana" might be a Sicilian word for ‚ÄúPersian,‚Äù _parmiciana_, and a reference to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Albeit unsubstantiated, this last theory hints at a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and plants rarely stay put in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

Eggplant is a culinary vegetable, but in botanical terms, it is a fruit, a berry in fact, since it contains small, edible seeds. Smooth, glossy, and often colorful, it resembles a fruit on the surface. Inside, however, its flesh is spongy, astringent, and sometimes bitter. Ambiguity also defines eggplant‚Äôs winding journey to kitchens across the globe. Start to dig into this history, and the eggplant quickly recedes into obscurity, where it long remained before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. In these regions today, people likely know of this nightshade and may have even let it pass their lips, as global cuisine abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include Eastern Mediterranean or Levantine cuisine like moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous. Other recipes include _Mchuzi wa Biringani_ or [Tanzanian eggplant curry,](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/) Indian Punjab _baingan bartha_ or mashed eggplant, Chinese Sichuan _yuxiang qiezi_ or fish-fragrant eggplant, and an infinitesimal number of other Asian preparations. But compared to tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, its relatives in the Solanaceae family, the eggplant lingers at the limits of diners‚Äô familiarity‚Äîunless of course their background is among the cultures who forged a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

### Sexualization of eggplant

In North America, eggplant might be more readily recognized as a sexual organ than as a food. In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the [eggplant emoji](https://emojipedia.org/eggplant/) as part of the keyboard of icons that now serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media. ‚ÄúAubergine‚Äù is the name for the eggplant emoji in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic visual display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was included in Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users outside of Japan.* In no time at all, the eggplant emoticon became code for an erect penis. On September 30, 2011, the first known use of the emoji as a phallic symbol appeared on Twitter, when @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted: im jelly no üçÜ üò•.* Now, for anyone the least bit tech-savvy in the US and Canada, the elongated, purple fruit with a bulbous end is synonymous with cell phone foreplay, or ‚Äúsexting.‚Äù

The digital age is just the latest chapter of the eggplant‚Äôs erotic entanglements. Written in Sanskrit roughly 2,000 years ago, the _Kama Sutra_ touts this nightshade as a libido booster. This ancient Indian self-help guide recommends rubbing the male member, or ‚Äúlingam,‚Äù with eggplant to produce ‚Äúa swelling lasting for one month.‚Äù* As questionable as it sounds, this claim is not too off the mark. [Recent](https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/mediterranean-diet-shows-promise-in-men-with-erectile-dysfunction) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893753/) have shown that eating more eggplant can reduce hypertension, a major cause of [erectile dysfunction.](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/high-blood-pressure-erectile-dysfunction) Around the time that the _Kama Sutra_ was written, practitioners of Ayurveda, a classical system of Indian medicine, knew about the many health benefits of certain wild relatives of the eggplant, species still found in pharmacopeias today.* Among the world‚Äôs earliest records of eggplant are foundational Ayurvedic texts like the _Charaka Samhita_ and _Sushruta Samhita_.* Written a millennium later, in the eleventh century, the _Taqwim al-Sihhah_ (_The Maintenance of Health_) by the Arab physician Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn of Baghdad features eggplant again in a sexual context. Translated into Latin and illustrated in Italy as the _Tacuinum Sanitatis_, this medical treatise includes versions depicting a woman and a man loitering by an oversized eggplant bush. Under the spell of the risqu√© fruit, they engage in a triste to the dismay of another woman who has happened upon them.

Sixteenth-century European artists often made visual puns with fruit and vegetables. _Gastronomica_ writer John Varriano notes the sexual innuendo of food and botanical imagery in painting and poetry of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. In Varriano‚Äôs chronology, eggplant might have first been visually equated with reproductive organs at the Villa Farnesina in Rome.* During 1517‚Äì1518, the artist Raphael decorated the loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche, and surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> penetrating a burst fig, and in this case, a pair of eggplants stand in for testicles. Varriano explains that behind this kind of visual ribaldry was the ‚Äúdoctrine of signatures,‚Äù the speculation that similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence.* An example of this thinking is eating walnuts to boost the brain since they resemble this organ. At the time, scholars like the Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta maintained that it was by God‚Äôs design that certain plants resembled the body parts of humans or animals. For example, Porta‚Äôs _Phytognomica_, published in 1588, includes an [illustration](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rr67jxat/images?id=pj99fsjc) comparing plant roots to dog genitalia.

### Europe and Western 'interest' and 'ignorance' about the plant

Cultural responses to eggplant in Early Modern Europe were largely dependent on the connection from which eggplant encounters came. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the eggplant cultures of India and China, with Iberic and Italian food culture influenced by Islamic and Jewish Mediterranean connections, and English botanists only finding eggplant through their European neighbours. The Hortus Malabaricus is a key exception, as a locally informed document of India‚Äôs south western coast, but that is more about potentially useful information than cultural connection.

### The expanding cultures of eggplants: agriculture and art in the 19th-20th century (PART 1) 

US and eggplant. Not until the nineteenth century did Northern Americans begin to significantly incoporate eggplant into their diet. Then its incorporation in horticulture, appearance of eggplant in growing guides, seed catalogs: rustic context. Measuring tapes and agricultural competitions. Normalization and naturalization.
