Eggplant parmesan, _parmigiana di melanzane_, or simply _parmigiana_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features‚Äîfar from straightforward. Where this dish originated seems to be in its name. _Parmigiana_ points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there is only a finishing touch, not a main ingredient. Instead, many credit regions in southern Italy as the birthplace of parmigiana. The food writer [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that records cleary indicate Naples as the origin of the dish as we know it today. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that "parmigiana" might be "palmigiana" mispronounced. This Sicilian word for "shutters" is perhaps a metaphor for the louvred construction of the dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Others claim "parmigiana" might be a Sicilian word for ‚ÄúPersian,‚Äù _parmiciana_, and a reference to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Albeit unsubstantiated, this last theory hints at a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and plants rarely stay put in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

Eggplant is a culinary vegetable, but in botanical terms, it is a fruit, a berry in fact, since it contains small, edible seeds. Smooth, glossy, and often colorful, it resembles a fruit on the surface. Inside, however, its flesh is spongy, astringent, and sometimes bitter. This ambiguity also defines eggplant‚Äôs winding journey to kitchens across the globe. Start to dig into this history, and the eggplant quickly recedes into obscurity, where it long remained before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. In these regions today, people likely know of this nightshade, and may have even let it pass their lips, as global cuisine abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include Eastern Mediterranean or Levantine cuisine like moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous; _Mchuzi wa Biringani_ or [Tanzanian eggplant curry](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/); Indian Punjab baingan bartha or mashed eggplant; Chinese Sichuan _yuxiang qiezi_ or fish-fragrant eggplant; and an infinitesimal number of other Asian preparations. But compared to its relatives in the Solanaceae family, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of diners‚Äô familiarity‚Äîunless of course their background is included in the cultures who forged a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

### Sexualization of eggplant

In North America, eggplant might be more readily recognized as a sexual organ than as a food. In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the eggplant emoji as part of the keyboard of icons that now serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media.* ‚ÄúAubergine‚Äù is the name for the eggplant emoji in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic visual display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was included in Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users outside of Japan.1 In no time at all, the eggplant emoticon became code for an erect penis. On September 30, 2011, the first known use of the emoji as a phallic symbol appeared on Twitter, when @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted: im jelly no üçÜ üò•.2 Now, for anyone the least bit tech-savvy in the US and Canada, the elongated, purple fruit with a bulbous end is synonymous with cell phone foreplay, or ‚Äúsexting.‚Äù

The digital age is just the latest chapter of the eggplant‚Äôs erotic entanglements. Written in Sanskrit roughly 2,000 years ago, the _Kama Sutra_ touts this nightshade as a libido booster. This ancient Indian self-help guide recommends rubbing the male member, or ‚Äúlingam,‚Äù with the fruit of an eggplant to produce ‚Äúa swelling lasting for one month.‚Äù3 As questionable as it sounds, this claim is not too off the mark. Recent studies have shown that eating more eggplant can reduce hypertension, a major cause of erectile dysfunction.* Around the time that the Kama Sutra was written, practitioners of Ayurveda, a classical system of Indian medicine, knew that certain wild relatives of the eggplant boast a host of health benefits, and these species remain well represented in pharmacopeias today.* Among the world‚Äôs earliest records of eggplant are foundational Ayurvedic texts like the Charaka and Sushruta Samhitas. Written a millennium later, in the eleventh century, the Taqwim al-Sihhah (The Maintenance of Health) by the Arab physician Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn of Baghdad features eggplant again in the context of human sex. This medical treatise was later translated into Latin and illustrated in Itlay as the Tacuinum Sanitatis.4 Some of these versions depict a woman and a man loitering by an oversized eggplant bush. Under the spell of the risqu√© fruit, they engage in a triste to the dismay of another woman who has happened upon them.

### Europe and Western 'interest' and 'ignorance' about the plant

Cultural responses to eggplant in Early Modern Europe were largely dependent on the connection from which eggplant encounters came. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the eggplant cultures of India and China, with Iberic and Italian food culture influenced by Islamic and Jewish Mediterranean connections, and English botanists only finding eggplant through their European neighbours. The Hortus Malabaricus is a key exception, as a locally informed document of India‚Äôs south western coast, but that is more about potentially useful information than cultural connection.

US and eggplant. Not until the nineteenth century did Northern Americans begin to significantly incoporate eggplant into their diet. Then its incorporation in horticulture, appearance of eggplant in growing guides, seed catalogs: rustic context. Measuring tapes and agricultural competitions. Normalization and naturalization.
