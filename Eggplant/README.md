### A Global Food
To turn a picky eater on to eggplant, many cooks defer to Italy and its breakout recipe <span eid="Q973455">
_parmigiana di melanzane_</span>. For good reason, eggplant parmesan is an international favorite, yet its exact origins are a matter of debate. "Parmigiana" points to northern Italy as the birthplace of the dish, but hard cheese from Parma is not an integral component, only a finishing touch. [The archive](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) points south to Naples, but a case has also been made for Sicily. "Parmigiana" could be a mispronunciation of "palmigiana," a Sicilian word for "shutters"—perhaps a metaphor for a casserole with alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. According to another theory, "parmigiana" sounds like _parmiciana_, Sicilian for “Persian," so the credit could ultimately go to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Mediterranean cooks centuries ago.[^1] But more important than who did what where first is a truth revealed by eggplant's jagged journey to kitchens across the globe: plants and their cultural repertoires rarely stay put; they much prefer to move and mingle.

World cuisine today abounds with dishes in which eggplant plays the star role. A few classics like moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous come from Levantine cuisine. Other gateway recipes include Indian Punjab mashed eggplant (_baingan bartha_), Chinese Sichuan fish-fragrant eggplant (_yuxiang qiezi_), and Tanzanian eggplant curry ([_mchuzi wa biringani_](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/)). Technically a berry as it contains edible seeds, eggplant is a culinary vegetable, and though it lacks much nutritional value, its cooked creamy texture and ability to sponge up flavors make it a kitchen hit. In Asia and the Middle East, eggplant is a dietary fixture, but in the West, it has yet to shake its stigma as a member of the Solanaceae family, known to harbor toxic alkaloids, whereas New World nightshades like tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes have been fully embraced.

The winding path of eggplant through space and time is mirrored by a [map of its current production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_eggplant_production). More than 80% of the world's supply comes from China and India, followed by Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia. While scientists debate the origins and historical distribution of eggplant,  most agree that today's common species were first domesticated in Asia over 2,000 years ago.[^2] Through east and westward diffusion, what was an ancient and storied plant in India and China became richly appreciated elsewhere. The late medieval period marked the arrival of eggplant in the Mediterranean and then northern Europe, where it initially provoked more interest as a suspicious exotic than as food or medicine. Around the same time, eggplant began traveling the networks of empire as an Old World crop in the Columbian Exchange. Each of these encounters demonstrate that once a plant is adopted into daily patterns of consumption, it's not long before it acquires a deeper cultural resonance.     

  

### A World of Eggplants

In 1753, Carl Linnaeus devised the scientific name of the eggplant, [_Solanum melongena_,](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/198/mode/1up) following the rules of his game-changing system of binomial nomenclature. But the etymologies of the various common names for this plant are far less neat and outline a cloverleaf of global exchange. North Americans refer to _eggplant_ thanks to the English who coined the term in the 1500s. But nowadays the Brits prefer the French word _aubergine_, which seems to be a corruption of the Arab word _al-babingãn_. Portuguese and Spanish speakers use the Arab-originated names _berinjela_ and _berenjena_. Much of this Western alphabet soup is owed to the base word _baingãn_ from India, which now also uses the term _brinjal_, a corruption of the corrupted Portuguese _berinjela_. Although certain African countries also use _brinjal_, the region of the former Ethiopian Empire opts for _mälänzana_, possibly imported from Italy, where this plant was first known as _mala insana_ ("crazy apple" in Latin) and finally as _melanzana_.

Dozens of eggplant varieties and cultivars are grown today,[^3] as this genus hybridizes easily, with or without human help.[^4] Horticulturists, gardeners, and cooks get excited when discussing the various cultivars. The creamy flesh of the Japanese Pickling, for example, is described as tasting mellow and sweet. Cultivar names also reveal the fertile imagination of their growers. There's the Fairy Tale, so called perhaps for its lovely violet skin with white stripes; the prolific Little Fingers, which grows in clusters of 20 fruits or more; the Black Beauty, like Anna Sewell's famous horse; or the hybrid Ichiban, meaning "best" in Japanese. The ornamental attributes of eggplants like the eye-catching white and purple Italian Rosa Bianca or the tiny watermelon-like Thai eggplant are admired almost as much as their flavor. And while the ubiquitous eggplant emoji is solid purple, the fruits can be white, red, yellow, green, reddish-purple, light purple, dark purple, black, striped, or "marbled."

### The Eggplant Emoji: Nothing New under the Sun

Europe and the Americas had a belated introduction to eggplant, and its relative novelty might explain why many North Americans today more readily recognize it as a sexual organ than as a food. In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the [eggplant emoji](https://emojipedia.org/eggplant/) for the keyboard of icons that now serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media. “Aubergine” is the name for the eggplant emoji in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic  display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was included in Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users outside of Japan.[^5] In the same year, the first known use of the emoji as a phallic symbol appeared in the tweet: im jelly no 🍆 😥.[^6] Now, for the tech-savvy in the US and Canada, the long, purple fruit with a bulbous end is synonymous with “sexting.”

The digital age is just the latest chapter of the eggplant’s erotic entanglements. Written in Sanskrit 2,000 years ago, the _Kama Sutra_ recommends rubbing the male member, or “lingam,” with eggplant to produce “a swelling lasting for one month.”[^7] As wild as this claim sounds, [recent](https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/mediterranean-diet-shows-promise-in-men-with-erectile-dysfunction) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893753/) suggest that eggplant reduces hypertension, a major cause of [erectile dysfunction.](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/high-blood-pressure-erectile-dysfunction) Practitioners of Ayurveda, a classical system of Indian medicine, documented the health benefits of the eggplant's wild relatives, species found in pharmacopeias today.[^8] Ayurvedic texts contain some of the earliest records of eggplant.[^9] Much later, in the eleventh century, the _Taqwim al-Sihhah_ (The Maintenance of Health) by Ibn Buṭlān of Baghdad eggplant featured in another sexual situation. Translated into Latin and illustrated in Italy, this medical treatise includes versions that picture a couple under the spell of the risqué fruit.

### Eggplant in the Renaissance: Between Art and Natural History

_Gastronomica_ writer John Varriano notes the sexual innuendo of food and botanical imagery in late Renaissance and early Baroque painting and poetry. In his chronology, eggplant might have first been visually equated with reproductive organs at the Villa Farnesina in Rome.[^10] During 1517–1518, the artist Raphael decorated the loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche, and surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> penetrating a burst fig, and a pair of eggplants stand in for testicles. Behind such visual ribaldry was the “doctrine of signatures,” the speculation that similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence.[^11] One example is eating walnuts for mental power since the folds and craters of these large seeds recall a brain. At the time, scholars maintained that it was by God’s design that certain plants resembled the body parts of humans or animals.[^12]

The Villa Farnesina features 21 images of eggplants [^13] Many Renaissance murals juxtapose plants and animals with figures of Classical mythology,[^14] forming menageries that convey the ambiguity of sixteenth-century science, when art and botanical study dovetailed.[^15] The Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo made studies of plants while serving the Austrian Habsburg family and working in an "avant-garde atmosphere" that included a _Kunstkammer_, a zoo, and parties in which the court dressed as the elements and seasons, following his designs.[^16] With great scientific fluency, Arcimboldo painted peculiar portraits. In _Zomer_ (1563), an allegory for "Summer" is composed of a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="549,1189,2196,1745">club-shaped eggplant,</span> a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1336,2149,1935,1673">white eggplant</span>, other fruits, vegetables, cereals, foliage, and flowers—all recognizable from a botanical standpoint. In _Vertumnus_ (c. 1590), the emperor Rudolf II is represented as the Roman god of the seasons and plant growth. A long eggplant helps shape his “neck,” defying the late medieval and early Renaissance idea that the fruits of trees were a luxury reserved for the nobility, while peasants were left with the “low” vegetables grown under or near the soil.[^17] Beyond the visual puns, his portraits have a political and philosophical significance, symbolizing “the copiousness of creation and the power of the ruling family over everything,"[^18] and the anthropocentrism of an era when man was seen as a summary of all creation.[^19]

### European Herbals: Secondhand and Thirdhand Encounters

In the sixteenth century, cultural responses to eggplant were shaped by the connections that allowed people to encounter this tropical plant. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the food cultures of India and China, as the eggplant traveled by Islamic trade routes to the southern Mediterranean. Italy and Iberia had key connections with the Islamic world in both trade and warfare and thus a third-degree connection to eggplant, through Islamic and Jewish communities. In sixteenth-century Italy, the doctor and naturalist Pietro Andrea Mattioli wrote wrote in his [_Senensis medici_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/125718#page/1251/mode/1up) that eggplant was “generally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms,” adding that “some of our people…feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love.”[^20] He also warned that this food was hard to digest and created digestive illnesses and long-lasting health issues. The New World tomato and the mythical “pomo d’oro” (golden apple) were often conflated as varieties of _melanzana_. This confusion might be why gold was applied to the eggplants in a copy of the [_Hortus Eystettensis_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/records/item/10908-redirection) by the botanist Basilius Besler, who cited Mattioli.

The German physician and botanist Leonhart Fuchs' botanical tradition owed much to Swiss and Italian scholarship, and his warmer climate in Tübingen connected him to these botanical cultures. He described eggplants as “sown in our gardens, but frequently in…hanging window gardens” with cucumbers and melons.[^21]  In the northern Mediterranean, the eggplant was initially met with some suspicion, even though these encounters were dictated mostly by the sharing of food. To suggest that suspicion of eggplant was greatly exaggerated, an amused Fuchs wrote that some people “immediately avoid the use of them, terrified by the name itself.” Although eggplant could grow in European climes, cultural bias against foreign foods shaped the way people interacted with the plant.

Authors of English herbals were one more step removed from eggplant than their southern counterparts and thus highly skeptical of this exotic. In 1597, John Gerard wrote that he saw only one fruit “of the bigness of a goose egg” in London. He recommended that English people should “content themselves with the meat and sauce of our own country,” because “these apples have a mischievous quality, the use whereof is utterly to be forsaken.”[^22] In 1699, the Scottish botanist Robert Morison describes them as “condemned by doctors as harmful and perverse.”[^23]  Much of Gerard's advice was copied by Philip Miller in his dictionary of 1754, which contends that “these plants are only preserved as curiosities in the English gardens” and only eaten by “some Italians or Spaniards.”[^24] We see culinary prejudice and aesthetic admiration towards plants several steps culturally removed from these authors. Just as the association with Islamic culture made Italians initially suspicious of the eggplant, its ties to Spanish and Italian culture made the plant seem strange to British gardeners.

Compiled by Dutch colonists in 1676, the _Hortus Malabaricus_ of 1678 took a different approach than that of herbalists in England and Germany, who warned their readers away from eggplant. This source on the plants of “Malabar” (modern-day Kerala) derived its information from locals. Much of its contents are attributed to the distinguished Indian herbalist Itty Achudan, who compiled local knowledge.[^25] The _Hortus Malabaricus_ lists the Braman name for eggplant, "Vaenna,” noting its use for curing toothaches and treating cows with internal abscesses.[^26] TThe Dutch “author” Van Rheede laments that “the fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but India produces edible nightshades!”[^27] In these cultural encounters, Europeans demonstrated a willingness to incorporate local plants into their herbal understanding while dreaming of potential profit and botanical innovation.

### The Eggplant in Western and Eastern Asia

Eggplant traveled light, leaving behind much of its cultural meaning, but it acquired new significance in the cultures that began consuming it. Long before northern Europe received this nightshade, it had reached the Mediterranean through networks of trade and conquest. A tenth-century calendar from Córdoba, Spain, mentions six varieties of eggplant, including one specific to that region. This special variety could have been a claim to a unique Cordoban culture made by the rebel caliphate that held the city at that time.[^28] By the ninth century, eggplant had become a luxury dish for the Islamic elite, as seen in the stories of a glorious feast for the wedding of the Baghdad-based Abbasid caliph al-Maʾmun and his vizier’s daughter, Buran. This lore was passed down into food culture, as various derivative eggplant dishes bear names like “Borani” or “Buraniyya.” During the Islamic Golden Age, the Persian polymath Avicenna (or Ibn Sina) documented the medicinal uses of eggplant. Based on other literary and linguistic evidence, Persia’s cultural repertoire included eggplant as early as the seventh century.

The routes that had brought eggplant west receded to India. Sanskrit documents written as early as 2,300 years ago attest to eggplant's importance to Indian cuisine and medicine. Ancient images of this plant are elusive, but early modern Indian art provides a view of _Solanum melongena_ different from that of early European herbals.[^29] In the mid-nineteenth century, Robert Wight, a worker for the East India Company, published _Illustrations of Indian Botany_, which includes drawings of eggplant and other plants attributed mainly to Rungiah and Govindoo, two artists associated with Tanjore painting known for depicting Hindu religious subjects in flat, saturated colors.[^30] Along with other local artists commissioned by European trade companies in India, Rungiah and Govindoo are also categorized as Company style or _Kampani kalam_, which blended European naturalism with the stylized, intimate qualities of Indian devotional art.[^31]

Art and literature attest to a long human relationship with eggplant in China, where this crop was cultivated no later than 59 BCE, the year of the first known written Chinese record of eggplant by the poet Wang Bao.[^32] Ancient literature reveals how Chinese farmers bred eggplants to be larger, longer, sweeter, and less bitter and spiny. For example, a sixth-century text states that eggplants were typically pellet-sized, but 600 years later, their size was compared to teacups.[^33] The [earliest known Chinese illustration of eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-2-uid-1) is in a materia medica written in 1061 CE, and around 200 years later, another text includes an [eggplant painted in vivid colors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-3-uid-2)[^34] Eggplant also appears in _Yinshan Zhengyao_ (Dietary Principles) written in 1330 by a Yuan Dynasty dietician of the Mongol emperor. This treatise lists several recipes, including stuffed eggplant, a dish that reveals China's long-standing Turkish presence.[^35]

The artistic and literary traditions show the insinuation of eggplant into neighboring Asian cultures. The Korean artist Shin Saimdang (1504–1551) made eggplant a subject of her still-life paintings that represent _Chochungdo_ ("insects on flowers"), a genre that carefully observes native flora and fauna.[^36] By the fourth century, Southeast Asians were cultivating eggplant, and the importance that the crop acquired in Vietnam is underscored by a sixteenth-century [water dropper](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_2001-1129-5_1) excavated at Hội An.[^37] In the eighth century, the eggplant crossed the Sea of Japan.[^38] The nineteenth-century agricultural text _Seikei zusetsu_ includes a sumptuous print of eggplant depicted in a hybrid style indicative of nearly two centuries of Japanese and European exchange enabled by the presence of the Dutch East India Company in Nagasaki.[^39] As people deepen their connections with plants, they treat them as more than sources of nutrition or medicine. For instance, since Japan's Edo period (1603–1867), eggplant has been part of the tradition of _Hatsuyume_, in which dreaming of Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant are regarded as auspicious signs for a new year.[^40]

### Atlantic Encounters and the Expanding (Agri)cultures of Eggplant 

Along with _S. melongena_, eggplant cultivars of Africa include the scarlet-colored guinea squash ([_S. aethiopicum L._](https://worldcrops.org/crops/garden-egg)) and the crunchy Gboma eggplant (_S. macrocarpon L._). _S. melongena_ was introduced to the Americas in the sixteenth century, but enslaved Africans also brought over guinea squash, according to the Dutch physician and naturalist Willem Piso in his document of Brazilian flora, the [_Historia naturalis Brasiliae_](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Naturalis_Brasiliae) (1648). Scholars Judith Carney and Richard Rosomoff argue that enslaved labor crossed the Atlantic bearing not only than the clothes on their backs, but also African food staples, including guinea squash, sesame, okra, watermelon, millet, sorghum, and black-eyed peas, and the skills and knowledge to farm such crops. Adapting to the new environmental and social conditions, enslaved workers cultivated “food fields,” which were a restricted form of access to land that afforded a degree of security, autonomy, and the “acknowledgment that not all of one's labor was owned by the master.”[^41]

While Southerners of the antebellum US incorporated eggplant along with other “foods that spread from the black hearthside to general consumption,” Northerners were slower to accept the guinea squash.[^42] A pamphlet published in 1891 states that “some of the neglect of the egg plant is due to the fact that cooks are not familiar with it.” The authors’ suggestions are the tried and true: “fried,” “fried,” “baked,” and “fritters.”[^43] Over time, Americans everywhere began incorporating eggplant into their diets, a trend verified by its regular appearance in growing guides and seed catalogs. Adolph Kruhm’s _Home vegetable gardening from A to Z_ (1918) presents the Black Beauty cultivar cinched by a measuring tape to showcase its girth, alluding to the qualitative and competitive spirit of modern agriculture. Kruhm’s growing tips for this crop still stand and begin with the statement: “Cool nights do not agree with this child of the tropics.”[^44]

### Expanding Cultures of Eggplant in Late Modern Art

As _S. melongena_ settled into Western culture, shedding some of its exoticism, its aesthetic appeal drew the attention of European and North American artists. Eggplant became an artistic subject, demonstrating how art and food are related even in highly industrialized and urbanized societies. This includes eggplant representations in the applied arts, such as in a eggplant-shaped [Majolica ceramic teapot](http://majolicasociety.com/majolica-history/) or a leaded glass screen made by Tiffany & Co for a transom window (a typical Art Nouveau design that depicts an eggplant bush with multicolored leaves and deep black fruit). In Henri Matisse's _Still Life with Aubergines_ (1911), eggplants represent much more than culinary ingredients. "Balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape,"[^45] they seem to be the visual starting point of a decorative explosion of textures and colors, which spread throughout the interior and beyond. One of Matisse's fundamental themes is revealed: the conversion of his own studio into a space permeated by _joie de vivre_ ("the joy of life"). In this personal recreation of the garden of paradise, his great admiration for Persian miniatures and Asian art emerge, and eggplants, without losing their domestic character, are reconnected to their origins in the "remote" Middle and Far East.

Decades later, the formal properties of the fruit became a subject of photography. Through abstraction and a highly refined sense of composition and light, Edward Weston depicts a dark globular eggplant, the same cultivar featured in agricultural literature at the time. As in many of his photos, _Eggplant_ (1930) unveils the unexpected and the marvelous in natural elements and everyday objects, as well as their resemblance to the human body.[^46] Although the dietary significance of the eggplant is still present, the shiny, ridged vegetable awakens both an aesthetic visual appreciation as well as the urge to touch the fruit and feel its smooth skin and firm flesh.

This visual and haptic appeal is more pronounced in the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, whose creative use of light and formal experimentation is derived from Weston.[^47] Mapplethorpe produced hundreds of nude studies and erotic photographs. Eroticism was the guiding thread of his gaze, permeating his portraits of women, men, flowers, and fruit, including a sensuous bunch of grapes and _Eggplant_ (1985). Here, a single vegetable lies alone in an unidentified space, whose neutrality is broken by banded light filtered through window blinds. Marked by sun and shade, the meaty eggplant seems to transform into a body or part of one. Its nutritional meaning falls away, and the eggplant can only be consumed as an object of lust in yet another example of its sexualization, and perhaps, its commodification in a hyper-capitalist society. The fruit’s curves and crevices stretch our imagination and resemble the curves and crevices of the equally appealing torso that fills _Thomas (Back)_ (1986), a depiction of an African American male model whom Mapplethorpe favored and posed in a similar studio setting.

### New Eggplants, Old issues: Bt Brinjal and Globalization
In recent years, eggplant has become the center of one of the hardest fought debates over genetically modified crops. Endorsed by Cornell University,[^48] varieties of Bt brinjal were designed by the US agrochemical giant Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) to withstand pests, thereby increasing yields and reducing the use of harmful pesticides. Although these varieties are cultivated in Bangladesh, they have been made illegal in India and the Philippines. Activists and research organizations accuse corporations like Monsanto—which own 53% of GM plant seeds[^49]—of bio-imperialist efforts to extract maximum profits under the guise of humanitarian concerns.[^50] There is also concern for the implications of meddling with ecological heritage impacting biodiversity by introducing “foreign genes that carry characteristics…not natural to the plant genome."[^51]

A US company not only exporting a genetically altered crop back to the regions from which it historically originated, but also maintaining ownership of the plant sparks controversy. Such cases are key to the kind of issues with which Plant Humanities deals. Plants are more than products up for genetic improvement and economic exploitation; they also have cultural meaning. Plants are woven into complex, fluid social relationships that bring together issues of human welfare, Indigenous ecology, the power of profiteering corporations, and the future of global food. Since its domestication, eggplant has been entwined in human culture, and now, as a global plant, it is squarely located in international conflicts with far-reaching consequences.

One idea is the significance of homophones in Japan. “Eggplant” in Japanese is _nasu_, which sounds like the verbs for “accomplish” or “succeed.”

A key problem with this is that the information needed to introduce GM crops in a way that sustainably helps farmers and ecosystems is very difficult to find, because scientific papers about the plant are too niche to evaluate environmental and humanitarian impact. This paper asserts that "farmers are pleased with the performance of Brinjal," but cites only a photo of a smiling man with a basket of brinjal as proof.
