Eggplant parmesan, _parmigiana di melanzane_, or simply _parmigiana_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features—far from straightforward. Where this dish originated seems to be in its name. _Parmigiana_ points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there is only a finishing touch, not a main ingredient. Instead, regions in southern Italy are often credited as the birthplace of parmigiana. The food writer [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that records indicate Naples as the origin of the dish as we know it today. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that _parmigiana_ might be _palmigiana_ mispronounced. This Sicilian word for shutters is perhaps a metaphor for the louvred construction of the dish, since it alternates layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Another claim is _parmigiana_ might be a Sicilian word for “Persian,” _parmiciana_, and a reference to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Albeit unsubstantiated, this last theory hints at a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and in this case, plants rarely stay put in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

Eggplant is a culinary vegetable, but in botanical terms, it is a fruit, a berry in fact, since it contains small, edible seeds. Smooth, glossy, and often colorful, it resembles a fruit on the surface. Inside, however, its flesh is spongy, astringent, and sometimes bitter. This ambiguity foreshadows eggplant’s winding journey to kitchens across the globe. Start to dig into this history, and the eggplant quickly fades from view, where it long remained before its belated introduction to Europe and the Americas. In these regions today, people likely know of this nightshade, and may have even let it pass their lips, since global cuisine abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include Levantine or Eastern Mediterranean moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous; _Mchuzi wa Biringani_ or [Tanzanian eggplant curry] (https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/); fish-fragrant eggplant or Chinese Sichuan _yúxiāng qiézì_; and an infinitesimal number of other Asian preparations. But compared to its relatives in the Solanaceae family, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of diners’ familiarity—unless of course their background is included in the cultures who forged a relationship with this tropical domesticate early on.

World distribution (historical? production? concentration of species?) Production, trade networks, etymology, genetics. Include: Growing information around the world. Culture: perennial in the tropics, annual in more temperate zones, growing zone # range, soil, ideal temperature, pests, diseases, seed saving, companion plants. Emphasize here or in the conclusion how eggplant is well-suited to hot climates, a growing concern with climate change.

Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. Typically used as a vegetable in cooking, it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the New World while the eggplant is of the Old World. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts.
