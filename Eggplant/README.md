Eggplant parmesan or _parmigiana di melanzane_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features—far from straightforward. Where this recipe originated seems to be in its name. "Parmigiana" points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there isn’t a main ingredient, only a finishing touch. Some food historians locate the birthplace of parmigiana in regions in southern Italy. The writer [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that written records indicate Naples as the origin of the dish. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that "parmigiana" might be a mispronunciation of "palmigiana," a Sicilian word for "shutters" and perhaps a metaphor for the louvered construction of the dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Others claim "parmigiana" might be _parmiciana_, a Sicilian word for “Persian,” and a nod to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Though unsubstantiated, this last theory gestures to a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and plants rarely stay in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

World cuisine today abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include Eastern Mediterranean or Levantine cuisine including moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous. Other recipes include _Mchuzi wa Biringani_ ([Tanzanian eggplant curry](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/)), Indian Punjab _baingan bartha_ (mashed eggplant), Chinese Sichuan _yuxiang qiezi_ (fish-fragrant eggplant), and countless other preparations. Treated as a culinary vegetable, eggplant is technically a berry since it contains small, edible seeds. Ambiguity also characterizes eggplant’s winding journey to kitchens across the globe. While this crop is a staple in Asia and the Middle East, it’s an auxiliary food in Western Europe and the Americas, where most people know of this nightshade and may have even let it pass their lips, but compared to its New World counterparts in the Solanaceae family, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, the eggplant lingers at the limits of their familiarity—unless of course their background is among the cultures who cultivated an early relationship with this tropical domesticate.

### A World of Eggplants

As a commodity, the eggplant is global, yet more than 80% of its [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_eggplant_production) occurs in China and India, followed by Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia. This distribution reflects how eggplant has been incorporated into various food cultures, and the extent to which each culture has incorporated it. Following the eggplant through global history demonstrates the reciprocity of plant-and-human relationships: culture and its agents define plants, and plants in turn define culture. In the case of the eggplant, what was an ancient and storied plant in India and China also became richly appreciated in the rest of the Far East, as well as in Persian and early Islamic cultures to the west. Home to many of eggplant’s wild relatives, Africa also established a deep connection with this crop early on. Through Mediterranean exchange in the early modern period, Jewish and Muslim communities helped bring eggplant into popularity in Italy, Spain, and Portugal—and by extension, the Americas. Eggplant also reached northern Europe, whose botanical communities were initially more interested in its exotic appeal than its culinary or medicinal uses. From Europe, the eggplant moved through the networks of empires into the modern global food trade.

The etymologies of [_Solanum melongena_ L.,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant) the scientific name for the common eggplant devised by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 following the rules of his game-changing binomial system of classification, constitute a way of understanding the global exchanges in which this plant took part. Still used by North Americans, the name _eggplant_ was coined in the sixteenth century by the English, who nowadays prefer the French word _aubergine_, which in turn seems to be a corruption of the Arab word _al-babingãn_. Portuguese and Spanish speakers also use the Arab names _berinjela_ and _berenjena_. The Indian term _baingãn_ is critical in this Western alphabet soup since it’s apparently the basis of all the other words. However, India now also uses the term _brinjal_, a corruption from the already corrupted Portuguese _berinjela_. Although certain African countries currently use _brinjal_, the region of the former long-lasting Ethiopian Empire is home to the word _mälänzana_, probably imported into Italy, where it was transformed into _mala insana_ ("crazy apple") and finally, the contemporary _melanzana_.

Eggplant has dozens of varieties and cultivars, as this genus hybridizes easily, with or without human help. Genetic analyses show that characteristics like size, shape, and taste were decisive in the eggplant's domestication, which began over 2,000 years ago. The size "changed from small to large, taste changed from not palatable to what was termed at the time sweetish,” and “a wider variety of fruit shapes was cultivated." Horticulturists, gardeners, and cooks get excited when talking about eggplant cultivars. The Japanese Pickling, for example, is described as "sweet and mellow tasting with creamy, meaty flesh." The names of cultivars reveal their grower’s fertile imaginations, such as the Fairy Tale, so called perhaps for its lovely violet skin with white stripes; the Little Fingers, which grows in clusters of 20 fruits or more; the Black Beauty, jet-black like Anna Sewell's famous horse; or the hybrid Ichiban, meaning "best" in Japanese. The ornamental attributes of eggplants are also admired, like the eye-catching white and purple Italian Rosa Bianca, the tiny watermelon-like Thai eggplant, or the Old White Egg, possibly the first eggplant to reach England in the 1700s. And while the ubiquitous eggplant emoji is solid purple, the fruits can be white, red, yellow, green, reddish-purple, light purple, dark purple, black, striped, or "marbled."

### The Eggplant Emoji: Nothing New under the Sun

Compared to much of the rest of the world, Europe and the Americas had a belated introduction to eggplant. Its relative novelty in the West might explain why many North Americans today more readily recognize the eggplant as a sexual organ than as a food. In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the [eggplant emoji](https://emojipedia.org/eggplant/) as part of the keyboard of icons that now serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media. “Aubergine” is the name for the eggplant emoji in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic visual display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was included in Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users outside of Japan. In no time at all, the eggplant emoticon became code for an erect penis. On September 30, 2011, the first known use of the emoji as a phallic symbol appeared on Twitter, when @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted: im jelly no 🍆 😥. Now, for anyone the least bit tech-savvy in the US and Canada, the elongated, purple fruit with a bulbous end is synonymous with cell phone foreplay, or “sexting.”

The digital age is just the latest chapter of the eggplant’s erotic entanglements. Written in Sanskrit roughly 2,000 years ago, the _Kama Sutra_ touts this nightshade as a libido booster. This ancient Indian self-help guide recommends rubbing the male member, or “lingam,” with eggplant to produce “a swelling lasting for one month.” As questionable as it sounds, this claim is not far from the mark. [Recent](https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/mediterranean-diet-shows-promise-in-men-with-erectile-dysfunction) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893753/) have shown that eating more eggplant can reduce hypertension, a major cause of [erectile dysfunction.](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/high-blood-pressure-erectile-dysfunction) Around the time that the _Kama Sutra_ was written, practitioners of Ayurveda, a classical system of Indian medicine, documented the many health benefits of certain wild relatives of the eggplant, species still found in pharmacopeias today. Among the world’s earliest records of eggplant are foundational Ayurvedic texts like the _Charaka Samhita_ and _Sushruta Samhita_. Written a millennium later, in the eleventh century, the _Taqwim al-Sihhah_ (The Maintenance of Health) by the Arab physician Ibn Buṭlān of Baghdad features eggplant again in a sexual context. Translated into Latin and illustrated in Italy as the _Tacuinum Sanitatis_, this medical treatise includes versions depicting a couple loitering by an oversized eggplant bush. Under the spell of the risqué fruit, they engage in a triste to the dismay of a woman nearby.

### Eggplant in the Renaissance: Between Art and Natural History

_Gastronomica_ writer John Varriano notes the sexual innuendo of food and botanical imagery in painting and poetry of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. In Varriano’s chronology, eggplant might have first been visually equated with reproductive organs at the Villa Farnesina in Rome. During 1517–1518, the artist Raphael decorated the loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche, and surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> penetrating a burst fig, and in this case, a pair of eggplants stand in for testicles. Varriano explains that behind this kind of visual ribaldry was the “doctrine of signatures,” the speculation that similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence. An example is eating walnuts for mental power since the folds and craters of these large seeds recall a brain. At the time, scholars like the Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta maintained that it was by God’s design that certain plants resembled the body parts of humans or animals. For example, Porta’s _Phytognomica_, published in 1588, includes an [illustration](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rr67jxat/images?id=pj99fsjc) comparing plant roots to dog genitalia.

The Villa Farnesina features 21 images of club-shaped eggplants, colored purple and white or deep yellow, indicating maturity. Many other illusionistic Renaissance murals juxtapose plants and animals with figures of Classical mythology—more examples of the ambiguity "at the heart of early modern scientific enquiry," and of a particular cultural climate that preceded the establishment of modern science. In the sixteenth century, interest in natural history dovetailed art and botanical study, pursuits that mutually benefited each other. Like Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, the Italian artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo included botanical illustration in his artistic repertoire, using this knowledge to create the visual puns that make his work a hit in museums today. Arcimboldo served the Habsburg family in Austria, working in an "avant-garde atmosphere" that included a [_Kunstkammer_,](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kuns/hd_kuns.htm) a zoo, and parties in which the court dressed as the elements and seasons, following the artist's designs. Arcimboldo is best known for portraits of people composed of painted vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, foliage, and flowers. In his painting _Zomer_ (1563), a club-shaped eggplant and an elongated, white eggplant suggest, along with dozens of other vegetables, the head and neck of an allegory for "Summer." In _Vertumnus_ (c. 1590), the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II is represented as the Roman god who presided over the seasons, change, and the growth of plants. Once again, an elongated eggplant is part of the emperor's “neck.”

       region="-970,1,6930,6376">

Not only visually striking, Arcimboldo’s compositions defied a distinction made in late medieval and early Renaissance thought, which considered the fruits of trees a luxury reserved for the upper classes, while peasants were left with the “low” vegetables grown under or near the soil. Arcimboldo had a great “scientific fluency,” as every plant in his work is recognizable from a botanical point of view. His oeuvre reveals the political and philosophical significance of the junction between art and natural history in the early modern period: beyond the visual puns meant to amuse king and court, his portraits also symbolize “the copiousness of creation and the power of the ruling family over everything," and the grand theme of dignitas hominis, where “man is a prodigy, worthy of veneration and honor, for his character summarizes all creation.”

### European Herbals: Secondhand and Thirdhand Encounters

In the sixteenth century, cultural responses to eggplant were shaped by the connections that allowed encounters with this fruit. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the food cultures of India and China, as the eggplant traveled by Islamic trade routes to the southern Mediterranean. Italy and Iberia had key connections with the Islamic world in both trade and warfare and thus a third-degree connection to eggplant, through Islamic and Jewish communities. In sixteenth-century Italy, the doctor and naturalist [Pietro Andrea Mattioli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Andrea_Mattioli) wrote that eggplant was “generally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms,” adding that “some of our people…feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love.” Mattioli also warned that this food was hard to digest and created digestive illnesses and long-lasting health issues. The New World tomato and the mythical “pomi d’oro” or golden apple were often conflated as varieties of melanzana. This confusion might have inspired a colorist to apply gold to the fruits of an illustrated eggplant in a copy of the apothecary and botanist [Basilius Besler’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilius_Besler) _Hortus Eystettensis_, which cites Mattioli.

The physician and botanist [Leonhart Fuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhart_Fuchs) described eggplants as “sown in our gardens, but frequently in…hanging window gardens” with cucumbers and melons. Fuchs’ German botanical tradition owed much to Swiss and Italian scholarship, and his warmer climate in Tübingen connected him to this botanical culture. Northern Mediterranean eggplant encounters involved some suspicion, but were dictated mostly by shared food culture. To suggest that suspicion of the eggplant was greatly exaggerated, an amused Fuchs wrote that some people “immediately avoid the use of them, terrified by the name itself.” Biologically speaking, the eggplant could grow in European climes, but cultural bias against foreign foods shaped the way people interacted with the plant.

One more step removed than the Italians and Iberians in their cultural encounters, authors of English herbals were deeply suspicious of eggplant. In his highly successful 1597 _Herball_ (and [Thomas Johnson’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Johnson_(botanist)) popular 1633 edition), [John Gerard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gerard) wrote that he saw only one fruit “of the bigness of a goose egg one extraordinary temperate year” in a merchant’s garden. He contended that “the people of Toledo do eat them with great devotion,” but “I rather with English men to content themselves with the meat and sauce of our own country,” because “these apples have a mischievous quality, the use whereof is utterly to be forsaken.” Gerard recommended “to esteem this plant and have him in the garden for your pleasure.” The idea of English people and English plants being suited naturally to each other, coupled with an inability to grow eggplant locally gave it a doubtful quality, which persisted over time. The Scottish botanist and taxonomist [Robert Morison's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morison) 1699 _Historia Plantarum Universalis Oxoniensis (Vol. 3)_ describes them as “condemned by doctors as harmful and perverse.” Much of Gerard's advice was copied straight into [Philip Miller’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Miller) famous _The Gardeners Dictionary_ of 1754, which contends that “these plants are only preserved as curiosities in the English gardens” and only eaten by “some Italians or Spaniards.” The concept of exotic plants and native goodness is important, as we see both culinary prejudice and aesthetic admiration of plants that are several steps culturally removed from these authors. Just as Fuchs suggested that association with Islamic culture at first made Italians suspicious of the eggplant, its ties to Spanish and Italian culture made the plant seem strange to British gardeners.

As a locally informed document of India’s southwestern coast, the [_Hortus Malabaricus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortus_Malabaricus) is a key exception, but one that is more about potentially useful information than cultural connection. The 1678 botanical work shows how Dutch imperialists collecting on their own terms had a very different approach to eggplant than the herbalists for whom the plant arrived at their doorstep. The “author” [Hendrik Adriaan Van Reede tot Drakenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_van_Rheede), governor of Dutch Malabar, was mostly informed by a distinguished local herbalist called [Itty Achudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itty_Achudan) on plant use. He acted as a collector of local knowledge and the curator of an account geared towards recording potentially useful local knowledge, rather than growing the European botanical corpus. Thus, the first piece of information recorded is the Braman name of the eggplant, "Vaenna,” and information that the fruit could be used to cure toothaches and that its juice "relieves cows from internal abscesses.” This is very different to the European herbals which assert that the eggplant is of "no medical use." Van Reede laments that “the fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but India produces edible nightshades!” This form of cultural encounter in which the Europeans have agency as collectors rather than as suspicious local recipients engendered a portrayal of amazement towards eggplant not found in the herbals written in Europe. Assessed as though it were a new discovery, eggplant was promoted for its potential profits.

### Eggplant in Western and Eastern Asia

Fuchs referenced the Persian physician and writer Avicenna (or Ibn Sina), as a source on eggplant, and attributed much of his knowledge to the medical system of the medieval Islamic caliphate. Islamic trade networks connected the territory of the early caliphates in the Middle East with the riches of East Africa and India, and in the process, brought eggplant into their food culture. The plant is frequently referenced in the tenth-century agronomy text _The Nabataean Agriculture_ by Ibn Wahshiyya, who aimed to record the ancient wisdom of Persia’s pre-Islamic cultures and credit them for their familiarity with eggplant. This suggests that Persian culture received the eggplant from India, and that it arrived in the southern Mediterranean through the conquests of the early caliphate. Stories of the glorious wedding feast of the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun to Buran in the ninth century include a story of the introduction of the eggplant as a luxury dish to the Islamic elite. This lore was passed down into food culture, as a wide variety of derivative eggplant dishes bear names like “Borani” or “Buraniyya.” A tenth-century Cordoban calendar mentioned the plant, and Wahshiyya wrote about six varieties, including a specific Cordoban one. At the time, the emirate of Córdoba was a rebel caliphate in the south of modern-day Spain, and from this connection, eggplant became part of Iberian food culture. The eggplant was absorbed from India into Persia and into Islamic culture as a luxury dish, which then found its way across the Mediterranean via Jewish and Islamic cultural movement and then into northern Europe. Nonetheless, eggplant traveled relatively light, and much of the ancient culture around eggplant in India, China, and the Far East did not come with it.

Competing theories about where eggplant was first domesticated comprehend a vast swath of the world from Africa to Asia, and India has figured large in this debate. Sanskrit documents written as early as 2,300 years ago attest to the importance of this fruit in Indian culinary and medicinal traditions, but visual representations of eggplant before the modern period elude present-day scholars. However, botanical imagery by Indian artists from the nineteenth century afford another view of Solanum melongena. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Scottish surgeon Robert Wight, who was assigned to southern India by the East India Company, published _Illustrations of Indian Botany_. This two-volume set includes elaborate plates based on illustrations attributed mainly to two Indian artists, whom Wight credited: Rungiah and Govindoo.^ Although not much is known about these artists, they were Telugu speakers and likely associated with Thanjavur painting, an artistic tradition which depicted Hindu religious subjects in mostly flat, saturated colors. Rungiah and Govindoo are included under the contested art-historical umbrella known as “Company School,” or _Kampani kalam_. Company style describes the art produced by the patronage of Indian artists by the British East India Company and other foreign companies during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This blend of European naturalism with the stylized, intimate, and flat qualities of Indian devotional art can also be discerned in a nineteenth-century watercolor painting of Solanum melongena from Calcutta. Also from West Bengal, a watercolor of a woman pulling a giant eggplant from a tree typifies Kalighat painting, a style that developed from religious art and portrayed themes of everyday life.

Art and literature attest to a profound human relationship with the eggplant in China, where this crop was cultivated no later than 59 BCE.^ We know this, explain the botanists Wang, Gao, and Knapp in their 2008 study "Ancient Chinese Literature Reveals Pathways of Eggplant Domestication," because this is the year of the first known written Chinese record of eggplant. In this text, _Tong Yue_ (The Slave's Contract), the poet Wang Bao advises transplanting eggplant seedlings during the spring equinox, advice that still stands for this frost-intolerant plant.^ His reference corresponds chronologically with the sowing of domesticated eggplant in the alluvial soils of southwestern China.^ Consulting 76 books in all, Wang, Gao, and Knapp track how Chinese farmers over time bred eggplants to be larger, longer, sweeter, and less bitter and spiny.^ For example, in the sixth century, a text states that the fruits were generally pellet-sized, but a record made 600 years later reports that eggplants were more the size of teacups.^ According to Wang, Gao, and Knapp, the [earliest known Chinese illustration of eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-2-uid-1) (1061 CE) is a print in the _Tu Jing Bencao_ or _Bencao Tujing_ (Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica) by Su Song of the Northern Song Dynasty. In another materia medica written around 200 years later, the _Lü Chanyan Bencao_ (The Cliff Walker's Materia Medica), the botanists find a [vividly painted eggplant.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-3-uid-2) Not only verdant, this eggplant is also naturally proportioned, since the artist Wang Jie used single perspective, which he adopted from Southern Song landscape painting.## A somewhat later illustration of eggplant appears in the _Yinshan Zhengyao_ (Dietary Principles) by Hu Sihui, a Yuan Dynasty dietician of the Mongol emperor.+ Completed in 1330, this treatise outlines food safety and lists several recipes, including stuffed eggplant, a dish that reveals China's longstanding Turkish presence.+ Out of the collapse of the Yuan dynasty arose the imperial Ming Dynasty. During this dyansty's centuries-long reign, foreign trade expanded, as China came into greater contact with outside cultures. The influence of Europe can be detected in the realism with which a pair of deep purple eggplants are rendered in a Ming-era still-life painting of vegetables and fruit held by the British Museum.

The importance of eggplant to China’s neighbors can also be gleaned from their artistic and literary traditions. A Korean artist of the Joseon Dynasty, Shin Saimdang (1504–1551), mother of the Confucian scholar and politician Yi I, included eggplant among still-life paintings on an eight-panel screen. These delicate compositions represent _Chochungdo_ ("insects on flowers"), a genre developed by Shin Saimdang, who emphasized careful observation of Korean flora and fauna.^ Among sites of eggplant cultivation, northern Vietnam is included in what some believe to be China’s earliest botanical treatise, the fourth-century _Nanfang Caomu Zhuang_ (Plants of the Southern Regions) by Ji Han. The ancient Vietnamese trading port of Hội An was the site where an early sixteenth-century [water dropper](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_2001-1129-5_1) in the shape of an upright eggplant was excavated. During the eighth century, eggplant reached Japan from China.* The agricultural text _Seikei zusetsu_, compiled in southern Japan around the start of the nineteenth century, features a sumptuous print of eggplant described as “Bohai,” possibly indicating its Chinese origins. As revealed by its hybrid visual style, this encyclopedic project was the outcome of nearly two centuries of exchange between Japanese and European scholarship through the presence of the Dutch East India Company in Nagasaki.# Since the Edo period (1603–1867), eggplant has belonged to a New Year’s tradition. In Japan, a _hatsuyume_ is the first dream that someone has after December 31, and dreaming of Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant are auspicious signs for the rest of the year. Different theories abound over the meaning of these items in this context. One idea is the significance of homophones in Japan. “Eggplant” in Japanese is _nasu_ (ナス), which sounds like the verbs for “accomplish” or “succeed.”% Numerous prints and other forms of [Japanese visual culture](https://collections.mfa.org/search/objects/*/eggplant%20fuji) juxtapose these three items.

### Atlantic exchanges

Eggplant was, and still is, an important food source in African countries. There, in addition to S. melongena, two other Solanaceae known as Guinea squash (S. aethiopicum L.) and Gboma eggplant (S. macrocarpon L.) are consumed, both of which have fruit with a characteristic bitter taste. While S. melongena would have been introduced in Latin America by the Iberian colonists, who, in turn, knew about it through the Arabs,* the Guinea squash would have been introduced by enslaved Africans from the sixteenth century onwards (check Willem Piso). Contrary to claims that slaves crossed the Atlantic with only the clothes on their backs, Carney points out that they brought also farming skills and knowledge, introducing longstanding African foodstaples (Guinea squash, sesame, okra, watermelon, millet, sorghum, black-eyed pea, among others) to the Western Hemisphere and adapting their cultivation methods to new environmental and social conditions. "Slave food fields," subsistence plots cultivated independently by slaves, were created in..... (Brazil, Jamaica... etc, check), and constituted as more than the physical space for growing food: they represented a form (albeit restricted) of access to land, in which emerged opportunities of economic autonomy (by selling the surpluses), an opportunity to strenghten subsistence security, and, signficantly, "the genesis of attempts to extract broader acknowledgment that not all of one's labor was owned by the master."**

### The expanding cultures of eggplant: agriculture 

US and eggplant. Not until the nineteenth century did Northern Americans begin to significantly incoporate eggplant into their diet. Then its incorporation in horticulture, appearance of eggplant in growing guides, seed catalogs: rustic context. Measuring tapes and agricultural competitions. Normalization and naturalization.

### The expanding cultures of eggplant: art

Agricultural expansion of eggplant culture, and its normalization as food in Northern Europe and North America since the 19th century, were accompanied by a promotion of this vegetable as an artistic subject, demonstrating how art and food are intimately related even in highly industrialized and urbanized societies. This includes examples of eggplant representations in the applied arts, such as the 20th century Portuguese Majolica ceramic teapot -- eggplant-shaped in purple and green (a very different form of representation in comparison to oriental vegetable-inspired objects, which usually reach a higher level of refinement and abstraction in relation to the imitated object). Another example is the leaded glass screen created by the North-American company Tiffany & Co. Their designs were very much in fashion around 1870-1890, and, as in other Art Nouveau creations, valued natural elements as a source of inspiration, creating elaborate patterns like the one in the panel, where a trellis provides the support for an eggplant bush with multicolored leaves and deep black fruit.

Avant-garde European painting also reveals the eggplant's expanding cultural meaning and its normalization as an household object -- as Paul Cézanne's _Still Life with a Ginger Jar and Eggplants_ (1893-94) and Henri Matisse's _Still Life with Aubergines_ (1911) demonstrate. In Matisse's painting, however, the three small purple eggplants represent much more than cooking ingredients; "balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape"*, they seem to be the visual starting point of a decorative explosion of textures and colors that spread throughout the environment and even beyond it (as the mirror, the window with the landscape beyond, and the open back door show). This painting reveals one of Matisse's fundamental themes: the conversion of his own studio into a imaginary space, permeated by the _joie de vivre_ (joy of life); in this very personal recreation of the garden of paradise, the painter's great admiration for Persian miniatures and Oriental art emerge; and eggplants, without losing their domestic character, are reconnected to their origins, beyond the Mediterranean, in the remote Arabias or in the Far East.

Decades later, North-American photographers further explored the formal properties of the fruit, its shape, color and texture. Throught abstraction and a highly refined sense of composition and light, Edward Weston (1886-1958) depicts, in _Eggplant_ (1930) a dark globular cultivar -- the same variety of US' agricultural manuals of the end of the 19th century. As in many of his works, here he unveils the unexpected and the marvellous of natural elements and everyday objects, and their connections with the human body**. Although the reference to the dietary significance of the eggplant is still present (as the white plate proves),  the shiny ridged vegetable awakens also an aesthetical visual approach, and the urge to actually touch it and feel the smoothness of the skin, the firmness of the flesh. 

This visual but also sensual sense gains strength in the work of Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-1989), whose style, according to Levinson***, is derived from that of Weston, in its creative use of light and formal experimentation. Mapplethorpe produced hundreds of nude studies and impactful erotic photographs. Eroticism is, in fact, the guiding thread of his gaze****, permeating his portraits of women, men, flowers and fruit, including a sensuous bunch of grapes and the famous _Eggplant_ (1985) portrait. Here, a single vegetable lies alone in an unindentified space, whose neutrality is broken by the striped shade of a blind. The meaty eggplant turns into a body or a body part, marked by sun and shade; its nutritional meaning seems to be lost, and, as an object of desire, the eggplant can only be eaten with lust and concupiscence, in yet another example of the sexualization of this vegetable -- and maybe of its commodification in hyper-consumerist societies. Its curves and crevices stretch our imagination and ressemble the curves and crevices of the equally appalling torso of _Thomas (Back)_ (1986), a black male model favored by the artist and depicted in a similar studio setting.

### New eggplants, old issues: BT-Brinjal and globalisation
Following the eggplant through global history shows the way plant meaning has been, and continues to be created through the interactions between cultural structures and the individuals who worked within and between them. What was an ancient and storied plant in India and China became a similarly richly appreciated plant in persian and in early islamic food culture. Through Mediterranean exchange in the early modern period, jewish and muslim communities brought eggplant into popularity in Iberia and Italy, and then by extension to an English botanical community primarily interested in its exotic, rather than culinary appeal. From Europe, the eggplant was carried through the networks of empire into the modern global food trade. In recent years it has become one the center of one of the hardest fought Genetically Modified crop issues as varieties of 'BT brinjal' endorsed by Cornell University designed to withstand pests and drastically reduce farmers' need to spray pesticide on their crops have been made illegal in India and the Phillippines but are cultivated in Bangladesh. The idea after thousands of years of and American institution sending the eggplant back in a changed form is a strange one, and this context is key to the kind of issues plant humanities deals with. The plant is not just a bare, lab grown improvement but a vessel full of cultural meaning. People question why an ancient 'indigenous' plant should need genetic modification and worry about the implications of meddling with ecological heritage. On the other hand, there is real chance through GM crops to improve people's lives and genetic engineering does not necessarily have to be so set against cultural heritage. If one thing is clear from the history of the eggplant, it is that human culture around food, medicine and ecology weaves complex, fluid meaning around the plants by which we live in ways that are powerful and important, but nevertheless fickle and difficult to pin down.
