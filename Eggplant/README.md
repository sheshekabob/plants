### The Eggplant Emoji
In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the [eggplant emoji](https://emojipedia.org/eggplant/) for the keyboard of icons that serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media. Aubergine is the name for the emoji name in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard became a part of Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users worldwide.[^1] Also in 2011, the first known use of an eggplant emoji as a phallic symbol was on Twitter, when  the handle @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted: im jelly no 🍆 😥.[^2] Now, “sexting” is inseparable from a long, purple fruit with a bulbous end.

For many North Americans, eggplant is more synonymous with a sex organ than what’s for dinner, but more generally, this crop is known as a culinary vegetable, though it’s a berry since it contains edible seeds and develops from the ovary of a single flower. Low in calories, but full of nutrients including vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber,[^3] the fruit of this plant has long been a dietary fixture throughout Asia and the Mediterranean, where cooks prize it for its versatility and ability to absorb flavors. World cuisine today abounds with dishes like eggplant parmesan <span eid="Q973455">_(parmigiana di melanzane)_</span>, South Asian mashed eggplant (_baingan bartha_), Chinese Sichuan fish-fragrant eggplant (_yuxiang qiezi_), Tanzanian eggplant curry ([_mchuzi wa biringani_](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/)), and <span eid="Q765174">Levantine</span> classics like moussaka and baba ganoush. However, many Americans and Europeans find its occasional bitterness and spongy texture challenging. Eggplant also carries more of the stigma of the <span eid="Q134172">Solanaceae family</span>, known to harbor toxins, than other nightshades like tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, American counterparts to the Old-World eggplant.

From its domestication in tropical Asia to its worldwide diffusion, the story of eggplant raises the question of why some ingredients become naturalized and accepted as common, while others remain perennially foreign. The history of this curious fruit and its global reception illustrates a statement made by the anthropologist Mary Douglas: “Like sex, the taking of food has a social component, as well as a biological one.”[^4]  In other words, “cuisine is not so much a matter of ingredients,” explains the sociologist Claude Fischler, “as of classifications and rules ordering the world and giving it meaning.”[^5] By transforming the raw into the cooked, cuisine is also a function of our desire “to tame the wild, threatening forces that inhabit nature.”[^6] In visual and written representations, eggplant is a kaleidoscopic signifier. Comestible, medicinal, poisonous, narcotic, aesthetic, or erotic, eggplant is rendered according to the degree to which the artist or writer’s culture has “tamed” this spiny Solanum.

### Local Names, Global Food

In 1753, <span eid="Q1043">Carl Linnaeus</span> devised the scientific name, [_Solanum melongena_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/198/mode/1up), for eggplant, following his game-changing system of <span eid="Q36642">binomial nomenclature</span>, but the etymologies of its common names outline a far messier cloverleaf of global exchange. Used by North Americans, the name _eggplant_ was coined by the English in the 1500s. Now the Brits prefer the French word _aubergine_, which seems to be a corruption of the Arab _al-babingãn_. Portuguese and Spanish speakers use the Arab-originated names _berinjela_ and _berenjena_. Apparently, most of this Western alphabet soup is owed to the Indian word _baingãn_, even though India now uses _brinjal_, a corruption of the already corrupted Portuguese _berinjela_. While some African countries use _brinjal_, the region of the former Ethiopian Empire opts for _mälänzana_, possibly based on _melanzana_ (“mad apple”) due to its status as an exotic nightshade.

As a quasi-vegetal berry that quickly oxidizes, is tricky to cook, and contains the toxic alkaloids solanine and nicotine, eggplant defies easy categorization, even the foremost rule of “what is food and what is not,” for those cultures who encountered it relatively late.[^7] The questions of where this crop was domesticated and how it was distributed evade scientists, but a [map of its current production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_eggplant_production) mirrors some of its journey across the globe. More than 80 percent of the world's supply comes from China and India—where certain species have been consumed for 2,000–4,500 years—followed by Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia.[^8] Over time, what was an ancient and storied plant in tropical Asia became richly appreciated throughout the rest of the continent. But when _mala insana_ reached Europe, it raised suspicion. Around the same time, the Columbian exchange introduced this “mad apple” to the Western Hemisphere, where it functions less as everyday fare and more as a sign of the erotic and exotic.

### A Long Affinity: Eggplant in Asia

Assumptions that eggplant was domesticated in the Indian subcontinent rest partly on Sanskrit documents written more than two millennia ago.[^9] Practitioners of <span eid="Q132325">Ayurveda</span>, a system of classical Indian medicine, made some of the earliest records of eggplant and documented its wild relatives, species still in pharmacopeias today.[^10] The <span eid="Q47228">_Kama Sutra_</span> (Principles of Love) also mentions eggplant, proving that its erotic entanglements are nothing new. This 2,000-year-old self-help guide recommends rubbing the male member with eggplant to produce “a swelling lasting for one month.”[^11] The ubiquity of this plant in Indian cuisine and medicine make it one of the few Solanums that the naturalist <span eid="Q1375864">Robert Wight</span> judges innocuous in his _Illustrations of Indian Botany_ from the mid-1800s.[^12] A product of the modern frenzy for not only studying plants as potential resources, but also picturing them in a mode of knowledge capture that Enlightenment taxonomists considered superior to written description, Wight’s project splices Linnaean classification with Indian decorative and devotional art, care of local illustrators, to present _S. melongena_ stripped of context and dissected, but animated by the same stylization and vibrancy found on a wall hanging or bedcover in an Indian home.[^13]

Art and literature also attest to a long human relationship with eggplant in China, where it was cultivated no later than 59 BCE, when the poet <span eid="Q2119204">Wang Bao</span> produced the first known Chinese record of this plant.[^14] Ancient writings reveal how Chinese farmers bred eggplants to be larger, longer, sweeter, and less bitter and spiny. A sixth-century text states that the fruits were pellet-sized, but 600 years later, they are reported to be the size of teacups.[^15] The [earliest known Chinese illustration of eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-2-uid-1) appears in a <span eid="Q1291275">materia medica</span> written in 1061 CE, showing that the fruits used to be rounder.[^16] Around 200 years later, another such text includes [a vividly painted eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-3-uid-2) that more resembles the purple, teardrop-shaped fruits of today.[^17] Written in 1330 when China was under Mongol rule, _Yinshan Zhengyao_ (Dietary Principles) lists recipes with eggplant, but regards as “slightly poisonous” the Chinese variety, which it says “moves wind and produces sores and even obstinate illnesses,” possibly because the court was more familiar with ingredients from Central and West Asia.[^18]

Cultural clues mark the path of eggplant from China to the fields and kitchens of its eastern neighbors. The fruits of a spiny, bicolored variety weigh down a still-life painting by the artist <span eid="Q464485">Shin Saimdang (1504–1551),</span> a Korean aristocrat who worked in the genre of _Chochungdo_ ("insects on flowers") characterized by careful study of local flora and fauna.[^19] Eggplant also weaved its way into the noble pursuits of Southeast Asia. A bottom-heavy fruit inspired the shape of a sixteenth-century Vietnamese [water dropper,](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_2001-1129-5_1) used in the art of calligraphy. By the eighth century, eggplant had reached Japan where it fully insinuated itself into the cuisine and culture.[^20] The agricultural catalog <span eid="Q76160295">_Seikei zusetsu_</span> (1793–ca. 1804) boasts a sumptuous print of eggplant depicted in a hybrid style, the result of cultural exchange with Europe.[^21] During the Japanese new year, eggplant transcends practical culinary categories to become (meta)physical fare. <span eid="Q1588971">_Hatsuyume_</span> refers to one’s first dream after December 31, and dreaming the following foretells good fortune ahead: Mount Fuji, a hawk, and eggplant.[^22]

Eggplant traveled light, leaving behind much of its cultural meaning, and so acquired new significance among West Asians. Persia’s cultural repertoire included eggplant just before the Islamic Golden Age from the eighth to the thirteenth century, when the Persian polymath Avicenna documented its medicinal uses. Eggplant quickly became a luxury dish for the Islamic elite, as told by stories of a glorious feast for the wedding of the Baghdad-based Abbasid caliph <span eid="Q61056">al-Maʾmun</span> and his vizier’s daughter, Buran. This culinary lore was passed down as derivative eggplant dishes bearing names like “Borani” or a recipe in <span eid="Q893318">“Borani”</span> or “Buraniyya.” During the Islamic Golden Age, the Persian polymath <span eid="Q8011">Avicenna</span> (or Ibn Sina) documented the medicinal uses of eggplant. Based on other literary and linguistic evidence, Persia’s cultural repertoire included eggplant as early as the seventh century.

### Eggplant in the Renaissance: Between Art and Natural History

Lacing food and botanical imagery with sexual innuendo continued in the late European Renaissance and early Baroque. According to _Gastronomica_ writer John Varriano, reproductive organs might have first been subbed for eggplant in Rome at the <span eid="Q1126723">Villa Farnesina</span> where a series of frescoes depicts a total of 21 eggplants.[^10] During 1517–1518, the artist Raphael decorated the villa's loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche. Surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> penetrating a fig, while two eggplants stand in for testicles. Behind such visual ribaldry was the “doctrine of signatures,” the speculation that similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence.[^11] According to this idea, since walnuts look like brains, eating these large seeds boosts mental power.

Many Renaissance murals juxtapose plants and animals with figures of Classical mythology,[^14] forming menageries that convey the interdisciplinarity of the sixteenth century when fine art partnered with botanical study.[^15] The Italian painter <span eid="Q7751">Giuseppe Arcimboldo</span> made studies of plants while serving the Austrian Habsburg family and working in an "avant-garde atmosphere," which included a _Kunstkammer_, a zoo, and parties in which the court dressed as the elements and seasons, following his designs.[^16] With great scientific fluency, Arcimboldo painted peculiar portraits. In _Zomer_ (1563), an allegory for "Summer" is composed of a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="549,1189,2196,1745">club-shaped eggplant,</span> a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1336,2149,1935,1673">white eggplant</span>, other fruits, vegetables, cereals, foliage, and flowers—all recognizable from a botanical standpoint. In _Vertumnus_ (c. 1590), Rudolf II appears as the Roman god of the seasons and plant growth. An eggplant helps shape his “neck,” defying the late medieval notion that tree fruit was a luxury reserved for nobility, while “low” vegetables grown under or near the soil were for peasants.[^17] More than visual puns, Arcimboldo's portraits symbolize “the copiousness of creation and the power of the ruling family over everything,"[^18] as well as the era's anthropocentrism which regarded man as the sum of all creation.[^19]

### European Herbals: Secondhand and Thirdhand Encounters

In the sixteenth century, cultural responses to eggplant were shaped by the connections that allowed people to encounter this tropical plant. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the food cultures of India and China, as the eggplant traveled by Islamic trade routes to the southern Mediterranean. Italy and Iberia had key connections with the Islamic world in both trade and warfare and thus a third-degree connection to eggplant, through Islamic and Jewish communities. In sixteenth-century Italy, the doctor and naturalist <span eid="Q457191">Pietro Andrea Mattioli</span> wrote in his [_Senensis medici_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/125718#page/1251/mode/1up) that eggplant was “generally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms,” adding that “some of our people…feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love.”[^20] He also warned that this food was hard to digest and created digestive illnesses and long-lasting health issues. The New World tomato and the mythical “pomo d’oro” (golden apple) were often conflated as varieties of _melanzana_. This confusion might be why gold was applied to the eggplants in a copy of the [_Hortus Eystettensis_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/records/item/10908-redirection) by the botanist <span eid="Q65027">Basilius Besler</span> who cited Mattioli, though eggplant can be yellow.

The German physician and botanist <span eid="Q60756">Leonhart Fuchs</span> owed much to Swiss and Italian scholarship, and his warmer climate in Tübingen connected him to these botanical cultures. He described eggplants as “sown in our gardens, but frequently in "hanging window gardens” with cucumbers and melons.[^21] In the northern Mediterranean, the eggplant was initially met with some suspicion, even though these encounters were dictated mostly by the sharing of food. To suggest that suspicion of eggplant was greatly exaggerated, an amused Fuchs wrote that some people “immediately avoid the use of them, terrified by the name itself.” Although eggplant could grow in European climes, cultural bias against foreign foods shaped the way people interacted with the plant.

Authors of English herbals were one more step removed from eggplant than their southern counterparts and thus highly skeptical of this exotic. In 1597, <span eid="Q1333338">John Gerard</span> wrote that he saw only one fruit “of the bigness of a goose egg” in London. He recommended that English people should “content themselves with the meat and sauce of our own country,” because “these apples have a mischievous quality, the use whereof is utterly to be forsaken.”[^22] In 1699, the Scottish botanist <span eid="Q281661">Robert Morison</span> describes them as “condemned by doctors as harmful and perverse.”[^23]  Much of Gerard's advice was copied by <span eid="Q312678">Philip Miller</span> in his dictionary of 1754, which contends that “these plants are only preserved as curiosities in the English gardens” and only eaten by “some Italians or Spaniards.”[^24] We see culinary prejudice and aesthetic admiration towards plants several steps culturally removed from these authors. Just as the association with Islamic culture made Italians initially suspicious of the eggplant, its ties to Spanish and Italian culture made the plant seem strange to British gardeners.

Compiled by Dutch colonists in 1676, the <span eid="Q5907004">_Hortus Malabaricus_</span> of 1678 took a different approach than that of herbalists in England and Germany, who warned their readers away from eggplant. This source on the plants of “Malabar” (modern-day Kerala) derived its information from locals. Much of its contents are attributed to the distinguished Indian herbalist <span eid="Q6095079">Itty Achudan</span>, who compiled local knowledge.[^25] The _Hortus Malabaricus_ lists the Braman name for eggplant, "Vaenna,” noting its use for curing toothaches and treating cows with internal abscesses.[^26] The Dutch “author” <span eid="Q741104">Hendrik van Rheede</span> laments that “the fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but India produces edible nightshades!”[^27] In these cultural encounters, Europeans demonstrated a willingness to incorporate local plants into their herbal understanding while dreaming of potential profit and botanical innovation.

### The Eggplant in Asia



### Atlantic Encounters and the Expanding (Agri)cultures of Eggplant 

Along with _S. melongena_, eggplant cultivars of Africa include the scarlet-colored guinea squash ([_S. aethiopicum L._](https://worldcrops.org/crops/garden-egg)) and the crunchy Gboma eggplant (_S. macrocarpon L._). _S. melongena_ was introduced to the Americas in the sixteenth century, but enslaved Africans also brought over guinea squash, according to the Dutch physician and naturalist <span eid="Q1385325">Willem Piso</span>. in his document of Brazilian flora, the [_Historia naturalis Brasiliae_](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Naturalis_Brasiliae) (1648). Scholars Judith Carney and Richard Rosomoff argue that enslaved labor crossed the Atlantic bearing not only than the clothes on their backs, but also African food staples, including guinea squash, sesame, okra, watermelon, millet, sorghum, and black-eyed peas, and the skills and knowledge to farm such crops. Adapting to the new environmental and social conditions, enslaved workers cultivated “food fields,” which were a restricted form of access to land that afforded a degree of security, autonomy, and the “acknowledgment that not all of one's labor was owned by the master.”[^41]

While Southerners of the antebellum US incorporated eggplant along with other “foods that spread from the black hearthside to general consumption,” Northerners were slower to accept the guinea squash.[^42] A pamphlet published in 1891 states that “some of the neglect of the egg plant is due to the fact that cooks are not familiar with it.” The authors’ suggestions are the tried and true: “fried,” “fried,” “baked,” and “fritters.”[^43] Over time, Americans everywhere began incorporating eggplant into their diets, a trend verified by its regular appearance in growing guides and seed catalogs. Adolph Kruhm’s _Home vegetable gardening from A to Z_ (1918) presents the Black Beauty cultivar cinched by a measuring tape to showcase its girth, alluding to the qualitative and competitive spirit of modern agriculture. Kruhm’s growing tips for this crop still stand and begin with the statement: “Cool nights do not agree with this child of the tropics.”[^44]

Dozens of eggplant varieties and cultivars are grown today,[^3] as this genus hybridizes easily, with or without human help.[^4] Horticulturists, gardeners, and cooks get excited when discussing the various cultivars. The creamy flesh of the Japanese Pickling, for example, is described as tasting mellow and sweet. Cultivar names also reveal the fertile imagination of their growers. There's the Fairy Tale, so called perhaps for its lovely violet skin with white stripes; the prolific Little Fingers, which grows in clusters of 20 fruits or more; the Black Beauty, like Anna Sewell's famous horse; or the hybrid Ichiban, meaning "best" in Japanese. The ornamental attributes of eggplants like the eye-catching white and purple Italian Rosa Bianca or the tiny watermelon-like Thai eggplant are admired almost as much as their flavor. And while the ubiquitous eggplant emoji is solid purple, the fruits can be white, red, yellow, green, reddish-purple, light purple, dark purple, black, striped, or "marbled."

### Expanding Cultures of Eggplant in Late Modern Art

As _S. melongena_ settled into Western culture, shedding some of its exoticism, its aesthetic appeal drew the attention of European and North American artists. Eggplant became an artistic subject, demonstrating how art and food are related even in highly industrialized and urbanized societies. This includes eggplant representations in the applied arts, such as in a eggplant-shaped [Majolica ceramic teapot](http://majolicasociety.com/majolica-history/) or a leaded glass screen made by Tiffany & Co for a transom window (a typical <span eid="Q34636">Art Nouveau</span> design that depicts an eggplant bush with multicolored leaves and deep black fruit). In Henri Matisse's _Still Life with Aubergines_ (1911), eggplants represent much more than culinary ingredients. "Balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape,"[^45] they seem to be the visual starting point of a decorative explosion of textures and colors, which spread throughout the interior and beyond. One of Matisse's fundamental themes is revealed: the conversion of his own studio into a space permeated by _joie de vivre_ ("the joy of life"). In this personal recreation of the garden of paradise, his great admiration for Persian miniatures and Asian art emerge, and eggplants, without losing their domestic character, are reconnected to their origins in the "remote" Middle and Far East.

Decades later, the formal properties of the fruit became a subject of photography. Through abstraction and a highly refined sense of composition and light, <span eid="Q346988">Edward Weston</span> depicts a dark globular eggplant, the same cultivar featured in agricultural literature at the time. As in many of his photos, _Eggplant_ (1930) unveils the unexpected and the marvelous in natural elements and everyday objects, as well as their resemblance to the human body.[^46] Although the dietary significance of the eggplant is still present, the shiny, ridged vegetable awakens both an aesthetic visual appreciation as well as the urge to touch the fruit and feel its smooth skin and firm flesh.

This visual and haptic appeal is more pronounced in the work of <span eid="Q312786">Robert Mapplethorpe</span>, whose creative use of light and formal experimentation is derived from Weston.[^47] Mapplethorpe produced hundreds of nude studies and erotic photographs. Eroticism was the guiding thread of his gaze, permeating his portraits of women, men, flowers, and fruit, including a sensuous bunch of grapes and _Eggplant_ (1985). Here, a single vegetable lies alone in an unidentified space, whose neutrality is broken by banded light filtered through window blinds. Marked by sun and shade, the meaty eggplant seems to transform into a body or part of one. Its nutritional meaning falls away, and the eggplant can only be consumed as an object of lust in yet another example of its sexualization, and perhaps, its commodification in a hyper-capitalist society. The fruit’s curves and crevices stretch our imagination and resemble the curves and crevices of the equally appealing torso that fills _Thomas (Back)_ (1986), a depiction of an African American male model whom Mapplethorpe favored and posed in a similar studio setting.

### New Eggplants, Old issues: Bt Brinjal and Globalization
In recent years, eggplant has become the center of one of the hardest fought debates over genetically modified crops. Endorsed by Cornell University,[^48] varieties of <span eid="Q4982032">Bt brinjal</span> were designed by the US agrochemical giant Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) to withstand pests, thereby increasing yields and reducing the use of harmful pesticides. Although these varieties are cultivated in Bangladesh, they have been made illegal in India and the Philippines. Activists and research organizations accuse corporations like Monsanto—which own 53% of GM plant seeds[^49]—of bio-imperialist efforts to extract maximum profits under the guise of humanitarian concerns.[^50] There is also concern for the implications of meddling with ecological heritage impacting biodiversity by introducing “foreign genes that carry characteristics…not natural to the plant genome."[^51]

A US company not only exporting a genetically altered crop back to the regions from which it historically originated, but also maintaining ownership of the plant sparks controversy. Such cases are key to the kind of issues with which Plant Humanities deals. Plants are more than products up for genetic improvement and economic exploitation; they also have cultural meaning. Plants are woven into complex, fluid social relationships that bring together issues of human welfare, Indigenous ecology, the power of profiteering corporations, and the future of global food. Since its domestication, eggplant has been entwined in human culture, and now, as a global plant, it is squarely located in international conflicts with far-reaching consequences.

The term _variety_ refers to members of a species with botanical characters (e.g., fruit color) that differ from those of other species members; "varieties" are natural variations that occur in species in their ecosystems. "Cultivar" differentiates a plant for its agronomic character; in other words, the plant has been cultivated for a characteristic that suits agricultural production.

Shelton et al., “Bt Brinjal in Bangladesh: The First Genetically Engineered Food Crop in a Developing Country,” _Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology_ 11, no. 10 (October 2019): a034678, https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a034678. A key problem with this is that the information needed to introduce GM crops in a way that sustainably helps farmers and ecosystems is very difficult to find, because scientific papers about the plant are too niche to evaluate environmental and humanitarian impact. This paper asserts that "farmers are pleased with the performance of Brinjal," but cites only a photo of a smiling man with a basket of brinjal as proof.
