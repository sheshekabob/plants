### The Eggplant Emoji
Originally designed by Japanese telecom companies, the <span eid="Q55267268">eggplant emoji</span> is part of the keyboard of icons that serve as the wordless shorthand of text messages and social media. The emoji is named Aubergine in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic and ‚Äúpicture‚Äù characters for electronic display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was added to the Unicode Standard, and a year later, Apple made the keyboard accessible to iPhone users worldwide.[^1] When the eggplant emoji debuted in the United States and Canada, ‚ÄúAubergine‚Äù was a relatively empty signifier ripe for a new association, one related to a topic of wireless conversation more routine than an Asian vegetable. Almost instantly, it became code for a phallus when, in 2011, the Twitter handle @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted ‚Äúim jelly no üçÜ üò•.‚Äù[^2] Now, ‚Äúsexting‚Äù or online foreplay is inseparable not with a banana üçå or an ear of corn üåΩ but with a long, bulbous purple fruit.

For many North Americans, eggplant is almost as synonymous with a sex organ as it is with what‚Äôs for dinner. But generally, the fruit of this plant is known as a culinary vegetable, though it‚Äôs a berry since it contains edible seeds and develops from the ovary of a flower. Low in calories, but rich in nutrients including vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber,[^3] eggplant has long been a dietary fixture throughout Asia and the Mediterranean, where cooks prize it for its versatility and ability to absorb flavors. World cuisine today abounds with dishes like eggplant parmesan <span eid="Q973455">_(parmigiana di melanzane)_</span>, South Asian pur√©ed eggplant <span eid="Q154872">(_baingan bharta_)</span>, Chinese Sichuan fish-fragrant eggplant (_y√∫xiƒÅng qi√©zi_), Tanzanian eggplant curry (_mchuzi wa biringani_), and <span eid="Q765174">Levantine</span> classics like moussaka and baba ganoush. However, many Americans and Europeans find eggplant's occasional bitterness and spongy texture challenging. This nightshade also bears the stigma of the <span eid="Q134172">Solanaceae family</span>, known to harbor toxins, even though its New World counterparts, tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes, are mealtime standards.

From its domestication in Asia to its worldwide diffusion, eggplant raises the question of why some foods become naturalized and common, while others remain perennially foreign. The story of this curious fruit recalls a comparison made by the anthropologist Mary Douglas: ‚ÄúLike sex, the taking of food has a social component, as well as a biological one.‚Äù[^4] Eggplant and its worldwide reception prove that people's relationship to food surpasses physical sustenance. ‚ÄúCuisine is not so much a matter of ingredients,‚Äù explains the sociologist Claude Fischler, ‚Äúas of classifications and rules ordering the world and giving it meaning.‚Äù[^5] By transforming the raw into the cooked, Fischler adds, cuisine is a way ‚Äúto tame the wild, threatening forces that inhabit nature.‚Äù[^6] More than a source of calories and nutrients, eggplant carries meaningful baggage, and in its various representations, it's a kaleidoscopic signifier. Comestible, medicinal, poisonous, narcotic, aesthetic, erotic, this spiny Solanum is rendered based on the degree to which it has been ‚Äútamed‚Äù to be good to think as well as to eat.

### Local Names, Global Food
In 1753, <span eid="Q1043">Carl Linnaeus</span> devised the scientific name [_Solanum melongena_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/13829#page/198/mode/1up) for the common or Asian eggplant, following his game-changing system of <span eid="Q36642">binomial nomenclature</span>, but the etymologies of its vernacular names outline a far messier cloverleaf of global exchange. Used by North Americans, the name _eggplant_ was coined centuries ago by the English, who now prefer the French word _aubergine_, which seems to be a corruption of the Arab _al-bƒÅ·∏èinjƒÅn_. Portuguese and Spanish speakers use the Arab-based names _berinjela_ and _berenjena_. Most of this Western alphabet soup is likely owed to the Indian word _baing√£n_, even though India now uses _brinjal_, a corruption of the already corrupted Portuguese _berinjela_. While some African countries use _brinjal_, the region of the former Ethiopian Empire opts for _m√§l√§nzana_, based on _melanzana_ from Italy, where the plant was first known as _mala insana_ (‚Äúmad apple‚Äù) due to its reputation as an exotic nightshade.

As a quasi-vegetable that quickly oxidizes, is tricky to cook, and contains the toxic alkaloids solanine and nicotine, eggplant defies easy categorization, even ‚Äúwhat is food and what is not,‚Äù for those cultures who encountered it relatively late.[^7] Though exactly where this crop was domesticated and how it was distributed remain open questions, a [map of its current production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_eggplant_production) mirrors some of its journey across the globe. More than 80 percent of the world's supply comes from China and India‚Äîwhere certain species have been consumed for 2,000‚Äì4,500 years‚Äîfollowed by Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia.[^8] Over time, what was an ancient and storied plant in tropical Asia became richly appreciated throughout the rest of the continent. But when _mala insana_ reached Europe, its mystique aroused suspicion. Around the same time, the Columbian exchange introduced this ‚Äúmad apple‚Äù to the Western Hemisphere, where it has faltered as everyday fare, but attracted other meanings with its aesthetic virtues.

### A Lasting Affinity: Eggplant in Asia
Assumptions that eggplant was domesticated in the Indian subcontinent rest partly on Sanskrit documents written more than two millennia ago.[^9] Practitioners of <span eid="Q132325">Ayurveda</span>, a system of classical Indian medicine, made some of the earliest records of eggplant and documented its wild relatives, species still in pharmacopeias today.[^10] The <span eid="Q47228">_Kama Sutra_</span> (Principles of Love) also mentions eggplant, proving that its erotic entanglements are nothing new. This 2,000-year-old self-help guide recommends rubbing the male member with eggplant to produce ‚Äúa swelling lasting for one month.‚Äù[^11] The ubiquity of this plant in Indian cuisine and medicine make it one of the few Solanums that the naturalist <span eid="Q1375864">Robert Wight</span> judges innocuous in his _Illustrations of Indian Botany_ from the mid-1800s.[^12] A product of the modern frenzy for not only studying plants as potential resources, but also picturing them in a mode of knowledge capture that Enlightenment taxonomists considered superior to written description, Wight‚Äôs project splices Linnaean classification with Indian decorative and devotional art, care of local illustrators, to present _S. melongena_ stripped of context and dissected, but animated by the same stylization and vibrancy found on a wall hanging or bedcover in an Indian home.[^13]

Art and literature also attest to a long human relationship with eggplant in China, where it was cultivated no later than 59 BCE, when the poet <span eid="Q2119204">Wang Bao</span> produced the first known Chinese record of this plant.[^14] Ancient writings reveal how Chinese farmers bred eggplants to be larger, longer, sweeter, and less bitter and spiny. A sixth-century text states that the fruits were pellet-sized, but 600 years later, they are reported to be the size of teacups.[^15] The [earliest known Chinese illustration of eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-2-uid-1) appears in a <span eid="Q1291275">materia medica</span> written in 1061 CE, showing that the fruits used to be rounder.[^16] Around 200 years later, another such text includes [a vividly painted eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-3-uid-2) that more resembles the teardrop-shaped fruits of today.[^17] Written in 1330 when China was under Mongol rule, _Yinshan Zhengyao_ (Dietary Principles) lists recipes featuring eggplant, a common ingredient in Mongolian cookery with its Central and West Asian influences, but the author regards as ‚Äúslightly poisonous‚Äù the Chinese variety, which reportedly ‚Äúmoves wind and produces sores and even obstinate illnesses.‚Äù[^18]

Cultural clues mark the path of eggplant from China to the fields and kitchens of its eastern and southern neighbors. The fruits of a spiny, bicolored variety weigh down a still-life painting by the artist <span eid="Q464485">Shin Saimdang (1504‚Äì1551),</span> a Korean aristocrat who worked in the genre of _Chochungdo_ (‚Äúinsects on flowers‚Äù) characterized by careful study of local flora and fauna.[^19] Eggplant also weaved its way into the noble pursuits of Southeast Asia. A bottom-heavy fruit inspired the shape of a sixteenth-century Vietnamese [water dropper,](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_2001-1129-5_1) used in the art of calligraphy. By the eighth century, eggplant had crossed the Sea of Japan and began insinuating itself into Japanese cuisine and culture.[^20] The agricultural catalog <span eid="Q76160295">_Seikei zusetsu_</span> (1793‚Äìca. 1804) boasts a sumptuous print of _S. melongena_ depicted in a hybrid style, the result of cultural exchange with Europe.[^21] During the Japanese new year, eggplant transcends practical culinary categories to become (meta)physical fare. <span eid="Q1588971">_Hatsuyume_</span> refers to one‚Äôs first dream after December 31, when dreaming the following means good fortune ahead: Mount Fuji, a hawk, and eggplant.[^22]

Eggplant traveled light, leaving much of its cultural meaning behind and acquiring new significance among West Asians. Persia‚Äôs botanical repertoire incorporated eggplant or _bƒÅdenjƒÅn_ just before the Islamic Golden Age, which ran from the eighth to the thirteenth century, during which the Persian polymath <span eid="Q8011">Avicenna</span> documented its medicinal uses. Eggplant quickly became a luxury dish for the Islamic elite, as told by stories of a glorious, month-long feast for the wedding of a ninth-century Abbasid caliph, <span eid="Q61056">al-Ma æmun</span> of Baghdad, and his vizier‚Äôs daughter, B≈´rƒÅn. This culinary lore was passed down as derivative eggplant dishes like _baadhinjaan buran_ (‚ÄúB≈´rƒÅn‚Äôs eggplant‚Äù), <span eid="Q893318">_borani_</span>, or [_buraniyyah_](https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200604/cooking.with.the.caliphs.htm). In the eleventh century, Ibn Bu·π≠lƒÅn of Baghdad featured eggplant in the medical treatise <span eid="Q608662">_Taqwim al-Sihhah_</span> (The Maintenance of Health)‚Äîlater translated into Latin and illustrated by Italian artists, who portrayed the nightshade as a potent aphrodisiac. Networks of trade and conquest eventually brought eggplant to the Mediterranean. A tenth-century calendar from C√≥rdoba mentions six eggplant varieties, including one specific to this Spanish region, which might have been a claim to a unique Cordoban culture made by the city‚Äôs <span eid="Q190418">rebel caliphate</span>.[^23]

### European Herbals: Secondhand and Thirdhand Encounters
Via trade routes connecting Italy and Iberia with the world beyond the Mediterranean, eggplant arrived in early Renaissance Europe, where it was received with a level of concern for public safety and morality. In sixteenth-century Italy, the doctor <span eid="Q457191">Pietro Andrea Mattioli</span> wrote in his [_Senensis medici_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/125718#page/1251/mode/1up) that eggplant was ‚Äúgenerally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúsome of our people‚Ä¶feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love.‚Äù[^24] He also warned that eggplant created digestive illnesses and long-lasting health issues. The New World tomato and the mythical ‚Äúpomo d‚Äôoro‚Äù (golden apple) were often conflated as varieties of _melanzana_. This confusion might explain why gold was applied to a print of eggplant in a copy of the [_Hortus Eystettensis_](https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/records/item/10908-redirection) by <span eid="Q65027">Basilius Besler</span> who cited Mattioli. Also in the 1500s, <span eid="Q60756">Leonhart Fuchs</span> a German botanist who created the University of T√ºbingen‚Äôs first medicinal garden, described eggplant as ‚Äúsown in our gardens,‚Äù but noted Europeans‚Äô suspicion of it, writing that some ‚Äúavoid the use of them, terrified by the name [_mala insana_] itself.‚Äù[^25]

Islamic and Jewish communities played a large part in introducing other Europeans to Asian food cultures. An association with Islamic culture made Italians suspicious of the eggplant, and similarly, its Spanish and Italian ties, along with a general wariness of nightshades, made the plant seem suspect to gardeners on the British Isles. Culinary prejudice and aesthetic admiration predominate in herbals by English authors, who were more culturally removed from eggplant than their southern counterparts and thus highly doubtful of this exotic. In 1597, the botanist <span eid="Q1333338">John Gerard</span> wrote that in London he saw fruit ‚Äúthe bigness of a goose egg,‚Äù but recommended that the English should ‚Äúcontent themselves with the meat and sauce of our own country,‚Äù because ‚Äúthese apples have a mischievous quality, the use whereof is utterly to be forsaken.‚Äù[^26] Much of Gerard's advice was copied by <span eid="Q312678">Philip Miller</span> in his _Gardeners Dictionary_ of 1754, which contends that ‚Äúthese plants are only preserved as curiosities in the English gardens‚Äù and eaten only by ‚Äúsome Italians or Spaniards.‚Äù[^27]

While herbalists in England and Germany warned their readers away from eggplant, the <span eid="Q5907004">_Hortus Malabaricus_</span>, compiled by Dutch colonists and published in 1678‚Äì1693, took a more open view. This record of the plants of ‚ÄúMalabar‚Äù (modern-day Kerala) derived its information from locals, and much of its contents are attributed to the distinguished Indian herbalist <span eid="Q6095079">Itty Achudan</span>.[^28] The _Hortus Malabaricus_ lists the Braman name for eggplant, ‚Äúvaenna,‚Äù noting its use for curing toothaches and treating cows with internal abscesses. The Dutch overseer of this project, <span eid="Q741104">Hendrik van Rheede</span>, laments that ‚Äúthe fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but India produces edible nightshades!‚Äù[^29] In such cross-cultural encounters, Europeans demonstrated a willingness to incorporate local plants into their herbal understanding while dreaming of potential profit and botanical innovation.

### Eggplant in the Renaissance: Between Art and Natural History
Like the eggplant emoji, the shape and color of _mala insana_ also stirred the imagination, if not the appetite, of European Renaissance and Baroque artists, who tended to lace fruit and vegetables with sexual innuendo. Reproductive organs might have first been subbed for _S. melongena_ in Rome at the <span eid="Q1126723">Villa Farnesina</span>, where a series of frescoes depicts a total of 21 eggplants.[^30] During 1517‚Äì1518, the artist Raphael decorated the villa's loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche. Surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a fig penetrated by a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> equipped with a pair of eggplants for testicles. Behind such visual ribaldry was the more sober ‚Äúdoctrine of signatures,‚Äù according to which similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence.[^31] An example of such thinking is eating walnuts to boost mental power because these large seeds look like brains.

Many Renaissance murals juxtapose plants and animals with figures of classical mythology,[^32] forming menageries that convey how sixteenth-century art partnered with botanical study.[^33] The Italian painter <span eid="Q7751">Giuseppe Arcimboldo</span> made studies of plants while serving the Austrian Habsburg family. Arcimboldo worked in an ‚Äúavant-garde atmosphere,‚Äù which included a _Kunstkammer_ (cabinet of curiosities), a zoo, and parties for which the court dressed as the elements and seasons, following his designs.[^34] The court artist also painted striking portraits with great scientific fluency. In _Zomer_ (1563), an allegory for ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù is assembled with a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="549,1189,2196,1745">club-shaped eggplant,</span> a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1336,2149,1935,1673">white eggplant</span>, other fruits and vegetables, cereals, foliage, and flowers‚Äîall recognizable from a botanical standpoint. In _Vertumnus_ (c. 1590), Emperor Rudolf II appears as the Roman god of the seasons and plant growth. An eggplant helps form his neck, defying the late medieval notion that tree fruit was a luxury reserved for nobility, while ‚Äúlow‚Äù vegetables grown under or near the soil were for peasants.[^35] More than visual puns, these portraits symbolize ‚Äúthe copiousness of creation and the power of the ruling family over everything,‚Äù[^36] as well as the era's anthropocentrism which regarded man as the sum of all creation.[^37]

### Atlantic Encounters: The Expanding (Agri)cultures of Eggplant 
While Iberians probably introduced _S. melongena_ to the Americas in the early years of conquest and colonization, enslaved Africans conveyed their own cultivars, including the scarlet-colored guinea squash ([_S. aethiopicum_ L.](https://worldcrops.org/crops/garden-egg)) and the crunchy Gboma eggplant <span eid="Q7479565">(_S. macrocarpon_ L.)</span>, as the Dutch physician and naturalist <span eid="Q1385325">Willem Piso</span> chronicled in his 1648 compendium of Brazilian flora, the [_Historia naturalis Brasiliae_](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Naturalis_Brasiliae). According to scholars Judith Carney and Richard Rosomoff, enslaved labor crossed the Atlantic bearing not only the clothes on their backs, but also their food staples, including African eggplant, sesame, okra, [watermelon](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/watermelon/), millet, sorghum, and [black-eyed peas](https://lab.plant-humanities.org/black_eyed_peas/), and the knowledge and skills to grow them. To gain some measure of security, autonomy, and ‚Äúacknowledgment that not all of one‚Äôs labor was owned by the master,‚Äù some enslaved workers cultivated ‚Äúfood fields‚Äù that allowed them restricted access to land.[^38] However, after the colonial period, the guinea squash and gboma were among the African indigenous vegetables of tropical America to be lost or much less frequently consumed.[^39]

While Southerners in the United States incorporated ‚Äúfoods that spread from the black hearthside to general consumption,‚Äù Northerners were slower to accept eggplant.[^40] A pamphlet published in 1891 states that ‚Äúsome of the neglect of the egg plant is due to the fact that cooks are not familiar with it‚Äù and suggests the tried and true ‚Äúfried,‚Äù ‚Äúbaked,‚Äù and ‚Äúfritters.‚Äù[^41] The regular appearance of eggplant in growing guides and seed catalogs in the late 1800s and early 1900s seems to indicate that more North Americans were adding it to their diets. In the competitive spirit of modern agriculture, Adolph Kruhm‚Äôs 1918 _Home vegetable gardening from A to Z_ showcases the girth of the Black Beauty variety with a measuring tape. However, since seed catalogs are as an exhaustive account of horticultural creation as one of Arcimboldo‚Äôs allegorical portraits, the marketing of a cornucopia of eggplant varieties might not indicate an actual major uptick in consumption. But for growers looking for crops that can withstand the hottest months in the upper end of the [USDA‚Äôs plant hardiness zones](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/), Kruhm‚Äôs growing tip for eggplant still stands: ‚ÄúCool nights do not agree with this child of the tropics.‚Äù[^42]

Dozens of eggplant varieties and cultivars are grown today,[^43] as this genus hybridizes easily, with or without human help.[^44] Horticulturists, gardeners, and cooks get excited when discussing the various cultivars. The creamy flesh of the Japanese Pickling, for example, is described as tasting mellow and sweet. Cultivar names also reveal the fertile imagination of their growers: the Fairy Tale which has lovely violet skin with white stripes, the prolific Little Fingers which grows in clusters of 20 fruits or more, the Black Beauty which recalls Anna Sewell's famous horse, and the hybrid Ichiban meaning ‚Äúbest‚Äù in Japanese. The ornamental attributes of eggplants like the white and purple Italian Rosa Bianca or the tiny watermelon-like Thai eggplant are admired almost as much as for their flavor. And while the ubiquitous eggplant emoji is solid purple, the fruits can be white, red, yellow, green, reddish-purple, light purple, dark purple, black, striped, or marbled.

### Aesthetic virtues: Eggplant in Late Modern Art
As _S. melongena_ settled into Western culture, its aesthetic and exotic qualities drew the attention of European and North American artists. Eggplant became an artistic subject, demonstrating how art and food are related even in highly industrialized and urbanized societies. Representations surfaced in the applied arts, such as in an eggplant-shaped [Majolica ceramic teapot](http://majolicasociety.com/majolica-history/) or a leaded glass screen made by Tiffany & Co., for a transom window using a typical <span eid="Q34636">Art Nouveau</span> design that depicts the plant with deep black fruit and multicolored leaves. In Henri Matisse's _Still Life with Aubergines_ (1911), three eggplants represent more than culinary ingredients. ‚ÄúBalanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape,‚Äù[^45] they are the visual starting point of a decorative explosion of textures and colors spread throughout the interior and beyond. In this picture, Matisse converts his studio into a space permeated by one of his fundamental themes, _joie de vivre_ (‚Äúthe joy of life‚Äù). In this personal recreation of paradise, eggplant, without losing its domestic character, is reconnected to its ‚Äúremote‚Äù Asian origins.

Decades later, the formal properties of the fruit became a subject of photography. With a highly refined sense of composition and light, <span eid="Q346988">Edward Weston</span> photographed a dark globular eggplant, the same cultivar featured in agricultural literature at the time. As in many of his pictures, _Eggplant_ (1930) unveils the unexpected and the marvelous in natural elements and everyday objects, as well as their resemblance to the human body.[^46] Although the dietary significance of the eggplant is still present, the fruit with its glossy exterior and bulbous shape awakens both an aesthetic visual appreciation as well as the urge to touch the fruit and feel its smooth skin and firm flesh.

Appeals to visual and tactile sense are more pronounced in the work of <span eid="Q312786">Robert Mapplethorpe</span>, who derived his creative use of light and formal experimentation from Weston.[^47] Eroticism was the guiding thread of Mapplethorpe‚Äôs gaze, permeating his portraits of women, men, flowers, and fruit. _Eggplant_ (1985) isolates a single fruit in an unidentified space, whose neutrality is broken by banded light filtered through window blinds. Marked by sun and shade, the meaty eggplant seems to transform into a body or part of one. As its nutritional meaning falls away,  the eggplant can only be consumed as an object of lust in yet another example of its sexualization, and perhaps, its commodification. The fruit‚Äôs curves and crevices stretch our imagination and resemble the torso that fills _Thomas (Back)_ (1986), a depiction of an African-American male model whom Mapplethorpe favored and posed in a similar studio setting.

### New Varieties, Old issues: Bt Brinjal and Globalization
Foods can be naturalized into a culinary repertoire, but they can also become estranged. In recent years, eggplant has been the center of one of the hardest fought debates over genetically modified crops. The US agrochemical giant Monsanto (now owned by Germany‚Äôs Bayer AG) designed varieties of <span eid="Q4982032">Bt brinjal</span> to withstand pests and thus reduce the need for pesticides. Although these varieties are cultivated in Bangladesh, they are illegal in India and the Philippines. Activists and researchers accuse corporations like Monsanto‚Äîwhich owns 53 percent of GM plant seeds[^48]‚Äîof bio-imperialist efforts to extract maximum profits under the guise of humanitarian concerns.[^49] Introducing ‚Äúforeign genes that carry characteristics‚Ä¶not natural to the plant genome‚Äù also raises concern over the impact on biodiversity.[^50] A company maintaining ownership of a plant and exporting a genetically altered version back to where it historically originated not only sparks concern, but also counts as an issue that requires insight from humanities-based research. Plants are more than products up for genetic improvement and economic exploitation: they have cultural and political meanings and are woven into complex, fluid social relationships that bring together issues such as human welfare, food sovereignty, and the power of profiteering corporations. As a global food, eggplant continues to be entwined in human culture, and now, it's squarely located in international debates with far-reaching consequences.
