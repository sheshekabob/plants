Eggplant parmesan or _parmigiana di melanzane_ is like the culinary vegetable that it features—far from straightforward. Where this recipe originated seems to be in its name. "Parmigiana" points to Parma in northern Italy, yet the hard cheese produced there isn’t a main ingredient, only a finishing touch. Some food historians locate the birthplace of parmigiana in southern Italy. The cookbook author [Clifford Wright](http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/4/id/109/) argues that written records indicate Naples as the origin. Those in favor of Sicily suspect that "parmigiana" might be a mispronunciation of "palmigiana," a Sicilian word for "shutters" and perhaps a metaphor for the louvered construction of the dish, with its alternating layers of fried eggplant rounds, tomato sauce, and mozzarella. Others claim "parmigiana" might be related to _parmiciana_, a Sicilian word for “Persian” and a nod to the culture that helped introduce eggplant to Europe.[^1] Though unsubstantiated, this last theory gestures to a truth greater than the facts of who did what where first. Food, culture, and plants rarely stay in a vacuum; they move and mingle.

World cuisine today abounds with eggplant dishes. A few classics include examples of Eastern Mediterranean or Levantine cuisine like moussaka, baba ganoush, and makdous. Other recipes include _mchuzi wa biringani_ ([Tanzanian eggplant curry](https://www.congocookbook.com/vegetable-and-side-dish-recipes/mchuzi-wa-biringani-eggplant-curry/)), Indian Punjab _baingan bartha_ (mashed eggplant), Chinese Sichuan _yuxiang qiezi_ (fish-fragrant eggplant), and countless others. Treated as a culinary vegetable, eggplant is technically a berry since it contains small, edible seeds. While this crop is a dietary fixture in Asia and the Middle East, it’s more of an auxiliary food in western Europe and the Americas, where most people know of this nightshade and may have even let it pass their lips, but compared to its New World counterparts in the Solanaceae family (tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes), the eggplant lingers at the limits of their familiarity—unless of course their background is among the cultures who cultivated an early relationship with this tropical domesticate.

As a commercial product, the eggplant is global, yet more than 80% of its [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_eggplant_production) occurs in China and India, followed by Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia. This distribution mirrors the winding journey of the eggplant to kitchens across the world. The most common species today were first domesticated in Asia over 2,000 years ago, before diffusing eastward and westward. An ancient and storied plant in India and China, the Asian eggplant also became richly appreciated throughout the Far East, as well as in Persian and early Islamic cultures to the west. Home to many of eggplant’s wild relatives, Africa also established an early connection with the _Solanum_ genus, and domesticated its own Ethiopian scarlet and African Gboma species.[^2] Through Mediterranean exchange in the early modern period, Jewish and Muslim communities helped bring the Asian eggplant into popularity in Italy, Spain, and Portugal—and by extension, the Americas. It also reached northern Europe, whose botanical communities were initially more interested in its exotic appeal than its culinary or medicinal uses. From Europe, the eggplant moved through the networks of empire into the modern global food trade. Throughout this history, each cultural encounter with the eggplant demonstrates the reciprocity of plant-and-human relationships: culture and its agents define plants, and plants in turn help define culture.

### A World of Eggplants

The etymologies of [_Solanum melongena_ L.,](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/198/mode/1up) the scientific name for the common eggplant devised by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, following the rules of his game-changing system of binomial nomenclature, help us understand the global exchanges in which this plant has taken part. Still used by North Americans, the name _eggplant_ was coined in the sixteenth century by the English, who nowadays prefer the French word _aubergine_, which in turn seems to be a corruption of the Arab word _al-babingãn_. Portuguese and Spanish speakers also use the Arab-originated names _berinjela_ and _berenjena_. The Indian term _baingãn_ is critical in this Western alphabet soup since it’s apparently the basis of all the other words. However, India now also uses the term _brinjal_, a corruption from the already corrupted Portuguese _berinjela_. Although certain African countries also use _brinjal_, the region of the former Ethiopian Empire is home to the word _mälänzana_, possibly imported from Italy, where this plant was first known as _mala insana_ ("crazy apple" in Latin) and finally as _melanzana_.

Dozens of eggplant varieties and cultivars are grown today,[^3] as this genus hybridizes easily, with or without human help.[^4] Horticulturists, gardeners, and cooks get excited when talking about the various cultivars. The creamy flesh of the Japanese Pickling, for example, is described as tasting mellow and sweet. Cultivar names also reveal the fertile imagination of their growers. There's the Fairy Tale, so called perhaps for its lovely violet skin with white stripes; the prolific Little Fingers, which grows in clusters of 20 fruits or more; the Black Beauty, jet-black like Anna Sewell's famous horse; or the hybrid Ichiban, meaning "best" in Japanese. The ornamental attributes of eggplants like the eye-catching white and purple Italian Rosa Bianca or the tiny watermelon-like Thai eggplant are admired almost as much as their flavor. And while the ubiquitous eggplant emoji is solid purple, the fruits can be white, red, yellow, green, reddish-purple, light purple, dark purple, black, striped, or "marbled."

### The Eggplant Emoji: Nothing New under the Sun

Europe and the Americas had a belated introduction to eggplant, and its relative novelty might explain why many North Americans today more readily recognize it as a sexual organ than as a food. In the late 1990s, Japanese telecom companies designed the [eggplant emoji](https://emojipedia.org/eggplant/) for the keyboard of icons that now serve as the shorthand of text messages and social media. “Aubergine” is the name for the eggplant emoji in Unicode, the universal standard for encoding linguistic characters for electronic visual display. In 2010, the emoji keyboard was included in Unicode 6.0, and a year later, Apple added the keyboard to its operating system for iPhone users outside of Japan.[^5] In that same year, the first known use of the emoji as a phallic symbol appeared on Twitter, when @iFUXXS_witHer tweeted: im jelly no 🍆 😥.[^6] Now, for the tech-savvy in the US and Canada, the long, purple fruit with a bulbous end is synonymous with cell phone foreplay, or “sexting.”

The digital age is just the latest chapter of the eggplant’s erotic entanglements. Written in Sanskrit 2,000 years ago, the _Kama Sutra_ recommends rubbing the male member, or “lingam,” with eggplant to produce “a swelling lasting for one month.”[^7] This claim is not far from the mark. [Recent](https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/mediterranean-diet-shows-promise-in-men-with-erectile-dysfunction) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893753/) suggest that eating more eggplant reduces hypertension, a major cause of [erectile dysfunction.](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/guide/high-blood-pressure-erectile-dysfunction) Practitioners of Ayurveda, a classical system of Indian medicine, documented the health benefits of some of the eggplant's wild relatives, species found in pharmacopeias today.[^8] Among the world’s earliest records of eggplant are Ayurvedic texts like the _Charaka Samhita_ and _Sushruta Samhita_.[^9] Written a millennium later, in the eleventh century, the _Taqwim al-Sihhah_ (The Maintenance of Health) by the physician Ibn Buṭlān of Baghdad features eggplant again in a sexual situation. Translated into Latin and illustrated in Italy as the _Tacuinum Sanitatis_, this medical treatise includes versions in which a couple loiters by an eggplant bush. Under the spell of the risqué fruit, they engage in a triste.

### Eggplant in the Renaissance: Between Art and Natural History

_Gastronomica_ writer John Varriano notes the sexual innuendo of food and botanical imagery in painting and poetry of the late Renaissance and early Baroque. In his chronology, eggplant might have first been visually equated with reproductive organs at the Villa Farnesina in Rome.[^10] During 1517–1518, the artist Raphael decorated the loggia with scenes featuring Cupid and Psyche, and surrounding his frescoes are <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1406,70,728,670">festoons by Giovanni da Udine,</span> who packed his paintings with garden produce. One arrangement includes a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1841,176,293,270">phallic bottle gourd</span> penetrating a burst fig, and in this case, a pair of eggplants stand in for testicles. Behind this kind of visual ribaldry was the “doctrine of signatures,” the speculation that similar-looking objects or organisms share an essence.[^11] An example is eating walnuts for mental power since the folds and craters of these large seeds recall a brain. At the time, scholars like the Italian polymath Giambattista della Porta maintained that it was by God’s design that certain plants resembled the body parts of humans or animals.[^12]

The Villa Farnesina features 21 images of club-shaped eggplants, colored purple and white or deep yellow, indicating maturity.[^13] Other illusionistic Renaissance murals juxtapose plants and animals with figures of Classical mythology.[^14] These naturalist–mythical menageries convey the ambiguity "at the heart of early modern scientific enquiry," when art and botanical study dovetailed in the sixteenth century, before later emerging as discrete disciplines.[^15] Many artists at the time like Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci included botanical illustration in their practices, and the Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo also made studies of plants, but for a unique purpose. Arcimboldo served the Austrian Habsburg family, working in an "avant-garde atmosphere" that included a [_Kunstkammer_,](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kuns/hd_kuns.htm) a zoo, and parties in which king and court dressed as the elements and seasons, following his designs.[^16] But the reason why this artist continues to be a hit in museums today are his portraits composed of vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, foliage, and flowers, each painted with great scientific fluency. For example, in _Zomer_ (1563), the head and neck of an allegory for "Summer" is suggested by a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="549,1189,2196,1745">club-shaped eggplant,</span> a <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="1336,2149,1935,1673">long, white eggplant</span>, and dozens of other plants, all recognizable from a botanical point of view.

       region="-610,-449,6210,7501">

Not only visually striking, Arcimboldo’s compositions defied a distinction made in late medieval and early Renaissance thought, which considered the fruits of trees a luxury reserved for the upper classes, while peasants were left with the “low” vegetables grown under or near the soil.[^17] In _Vertumnus_ (c. 1590), the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II is represented as the Roman god who presided over the seasons, change, and the growth of plants. Once again, an <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="4882,6501,3963,3426">elongated eggplant,</span> along with turnips, onions, and gourds, is part of the emperor's “neck.” The artist's oeuvre reveals the political and philosophical significance of the junction between art and natural history in the early modern period: beyond the visual puns meant to amuse king and court, his portraits also symbolize “the copiousness of creation and the power of the ruling family over everything,"[^18] and the grand theme of _dignitas hominis_, where “man is a prodigy, worthy of veneration and honor, for his character summarizes all creation.”[^19]

### European Herbals: Secondhand and Thirdhand Encounters

In the sixteenth century, cultural responses to eggplant were shaped by the connections that permitted people to encounter this tropical fruit. Europeans were usually two or three steps removed from the food cultures of India and China, as the eggplant traveled by Islamic trade routes to the southern Mediterranean. Italy and Iberia had key connections with the Islamic world in both trade and warfare and thus a third-degree connection to eggplant, through Islamic and Jewish communities. In sixteenth-century Italy, the doctor and naturalist Pietro Andrea Mattioli wrote that eggplant was “generally eaten cooked with oil, salt, pepper and mushrooms,” adding that “some of our people…feed on the mad-apple in order to arouse love.”[^20] He also warned that this food was hard to digest and created digestive illnesses and long-lasting health issues. The New World tomato and the mythical “pomo d’oro” (golden apple) were often conflated as varieties of _melanzana_. This confusion might be why gold was applied to the eggplants in a copy of the _Hortus Eystettensis_ by the botanist Basilius Besler, who cited Mattioli.

The physician and botanist Leonhart Fuchs described eggplants as “sown in our gardens, but frequently in…hanging window gardens” with cucumbers and melons.[^21] Fuchs’ German botanical tradition owed much to Swiss and Italian scholarship, and his warmer climate in Tübingen connected him to these botanical cultures. In the northern Mediterranean, the eggplant was initially met with some suspicion, even though these encounters were dictated mostly by the sharing of food. To suggest that suspicion of eggplant was greatly exaggerated, an amused Fuchs wrote that some people “immediately avoid the use of them, terrified by the name itself.” Even though eggplant could grow in European climes, cultural bias against foreign foods shaped the way people interacted with the plant.

Authors of English herbals were one more step removed from eggplant than their southern counterparts and thus highly skeptical of this exotic. In his  successful 1597 _Herball_ (and Thomas Johnson’s popular 1633 edition), John Gerard wrote that he saw only one fruit “of the bigness of a goose egg one extraordinary temperate year” in a merchant’s garden. He contended that “the people of Toledo do eat them with great devotion,” but “I rather with English men to content themselves with the meat and sauce of our own country,” because “these apples have a mischievous quality, the use whereof is utterly to be forsaken.”[^22] The idea of English people and English plants being suited naturally to each other, coupled with an inability to grow eggplant locally, gave it a doubtful quality, which persisted. In the _Historia Plantarum Universalis Oxoniensis (Vol. 3)_ of 1699, the Scottish botanist Robert Morison describes them as “condemned by doctors as harmful and perverse.”[^23]  Much of Gerard's advice was copied by Philip Miller in his famous _The Gardeners Dictionary_ of 1754, which contends that “these plants are only preserved as curiosities in the English gardens” and only eaten by “some Italians or Spaniards.”[^24]  The concept of exotic plants and native goodness is important, as we see both culinary prejudice and aesthetic admiration of plants several steps culturally removed from these authors. Just as Fuchs suggested that association with Islamic culture at first made Italians suspicious of the eggplant, its ties to Spanish and Italian culture made the plant seem strange to British gardeners.

As a locally informed document of India’s southwestern coast, the _Hortus Malabaricus_ of 1678 is a key exception, but one that is more about potentially useful information than cultural connection. This botanical work on the plants of “Malabar” (modern-day Kerala) shows how Dutch imperialists collecting on their own terms had a very different approach to eggplant than the herbalists for whom the plant arrived at their doorstep. The “author” Hendrik van Rheede, governor of Dutch Malabar, was mostly informed on plant use by the distinguished Indian herbalist Itty Achudan, who acted as a curator of an account geared towards recording useful local knowledge.[^25] Thus, the first information recorded was the Braman name for eggplant, "Vaenna,” with the note that it could be used to cure toothaches, and its juice "relieves cows from internal abscesses.”[^26] This differs greatly from the warnings against eggplant found in the European herbals, whose main objective was to increase the European botanical corpus. Van Reede laments that “the fruit of the nightshade in our homeland is a narcotic power: but India produces edible nightshades!”[^27] Cultural encounters in which the Europeans were collectors, rather than suspicious recipients, demonstrated amazement towards eggplant, while promoting it for potential profit.

### Eggplant in Western and Eastern Asia

Fuchs referenced the Persian physician and writer Avicenna (or Ibn Sina), as a source on eggplant, and attributed much of his knowledge to the medical system of the medieval Islamic caliphate. Islamic trade networks connected the territory of the early caliphates in the Middle East with the riches of East Africa and India, and in the process, brought eggplant into their food culture. The plant is frequently referenced in the tenth-century agronomy text _The Nabataean Agriculture_ by Ibn Wahshiyya, who aimed to record the ancient wisdom of Persia’s pre-Islamic cultures and credit them for their familiarity with eggplant. This suggests that Persian culture received the eggplant from India, and that it arrived in the southern Mediterranean through the conquests of the caliphate. Stories of a glorious feast for the wedding of the Abbasid caliph al-Maʾmun to Buran, the daughter of his vizier, in the ninth century reveal the eggplant as a luxury dish to the Islamic elite. This lore was passed down into food culture, as a wide variety of derivative eggplant dishes bear names like “Borani” or “Buraniyya.” A tenth-century Cordoban calendar mentioned the plant, and Wahshiyya wrote about six varieties, including a specific Cordoban one. At the time, the emirate of Córdoba was a rebel caliphate in the south of modern-day Spain, and from this connection, eggplant became part of Iberian food culture.[^28] But eggplant traveled relatively light, and much of the ancient culture around this crop stayed in India, China, and the Far East.

Sanskrit documents written as early as 2,300 years ago attest to eggplant's importance to Indian cuisine and medicine. Ancient images of this plant are elusive, but early modern Indian art provides another view of _Solanum melongena_.[^29] In the mid-nineteenth century, Robert Wight, a worker for the East India Company, published _Illustrations of Indian Botany_, which includes drawings of eggplant and other plants attributed mainly to Rungiah and Govindoo, two artists associated with Tanjore painting known for its depictions of Hindu religious subjects in flat, saturated colors.[^30] Along with other local artists commissioned by European trade companies, Rungiah and Govindoo are also considered part of “Company School” or _Kampani kalam_ painting, which blends European naturalism and the stylized, intimate qualities of Indian devotional art.[^31]

Art and literature attest to a long human relationship with eggplant in China, where this crop was cultivated no later than 59 BCE, the year of the first known written Chinese record of eggplant made by the poet Wang Bao.[^32] Ancient literature reveals how Chinese farmers bred eggplants to be larger, longer, sweeter, and less bitter and spiny. For example, a sixth-century text states that eggplants were typically pellet-sized, but 600 years later, the size of the fruits were comparable to teacups.[^33] The [earliest known Chinese illustration of eggplant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-2-uid-1) is in a materia medica written in 1061 CE, and around 200 years later another materia medica includes a [vividly painted eggplant.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18819950/#&gid=article-figures&pid=fscigsc-3-uid-2)[^34] Eggplant also appears in the _Yinshan Zhengyao_ (Dietary Principles) by a Yuan Dynasty dietician of the Mongol emperor. Completed in 1330, this treatise lists several recipes, including stuffed eggplant, a dish that reveals China's longstanding Turkish presence.[^35]

The artistic and literary traditions of China’s neighbors show the insinuation of eggplant in other Asian cultures. The Korean artist Shin Saimdang (1504–1551) made eggplant a subject of her still-life paintings. These delicate compositions represent _Chochungdo_ ("insects on flowers"), a genre that carefully observes native flora and fauna.[^36] Chinese records indicate that Southeast Asians were cultivating eggplant by the fourth century, and the importance that the crop acquired in Vietnam is marterialized by a sixteenth-century [water dropper](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_2001-1129-5_1), excavated at the trading port of Hội An.[^37] In the eighth century, the eggplant reached Japan.[^38] The Japanese agricultural text _Seikei zusetsu_ compiled in the  nineteenth century includes a sumptuous print of eggplant, which is described as “Bohai,” possibly indicating its Chinese origins. The hybrid style of this manuscript hints that it is a product of nearly two centuries of Japanese and European exchange enabled by the presence of the Dutch East India Company in Nagasaki.[^39] Since Japan's Edo period (1603–1867), eggplant has been a part of a New Year’s tradition. _Hatsuyume_ is the first dream that someone has after December 31, and dreaming of Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant are auspicious signs for the rest of the year.[^40]

### Atlantic Encounters and the Expanding (Agri)cultures of Eggplant 

Eggplant remains an important food source in countries of Africa. Along with _S. melongena_, two other Solanaceae, guinea squash (the scarlet-colored and bitter [_S. aethiopicum L._](https://worldcrops.org/crops/garden-egg)) and Gboma eggplant (the crunchy-textured _S. macrocarpon L._), are cultivated in the central and west part of the continent. While _S. melongena_ was introduced to the Americas by Iberian colonists, guinea squash was introduced by enslaved Africans in the sixteenth century, as confirmed by Dutch physician and naturalist Willem Piso, who in the [_Historia naturalis Brasiliae_](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Naturalis_Brasiliae) (1648) includes guinea squash in illustrations and descriptions of Brazilian flora and fauna. Contrary to claims that enslaved labor crossed the Atlantic with only the clothes on their backs, Judith Carney and Richard Rosomoff point out that they brought farming skills and knowledge and introduced longstanding African food staples, like guinea squash, sesame, okra, watermelon, millet, sorghum, black-eyed pea, among others, to the Western Hemisphere, and adapted their cultivation methods to new environmental and social conditions. Enslaved Africans independently cultivated “food fields,” or subsistence plots, which constituted more than the physical space for growing food; they represented a restricted form of access to land and afforded some degree of food security, economic autonomy, and, significantly, “the broader acknowledgment that not all of one's labor was owned by the master.”[^41]

According to David Shields, the antebellum southern US incorporated eggplant along with “foods that spread from the black hearthside to general consumption.”[^42] US Northerners took longer to embrace the guinea squash. A pamphlet published in 1891 states that “some of the neglect of the egg plant is due to the fact that cooks are not familiar with it.” The authors’ suggestions are the tried and true: “fried,” “fried,” “baked,” and “fritters.”[^43] Over time, Americans everywhere gradually began incorporating eggplant into their diets, a trend verified by its regular appearance in growing guides and seed catalogs. A photograph in Adolph Kruhm’s _Home vegetable gardening from A to Z, with special reference to Pacific coast conditions_ (1918) presents the Black Beauty cultivar cinched by a measuring tape to advertise its girth, alluding to the qualitative and competitive spirit of modern agriculture. Kruhm’s growing tips for this crop still stand and begin with the statement: “Cool nights do not agree with this child of the tropics.”[^44] A tropical perennial, eggplant functions as an annual in more temperate zones.

### Expanding Cultures of Eggplant in Late Modern Art

As _S. melongena_ settled into Western culture, shedding some of its exoticism and becoming more normalized, its aesthetic appeal drew the attention of European and North American artists. Eggplant became an artistic subject, demonstrating how art and food are intimately related even in highly industrialized and urbanized societies. This includes examples of eggplant representations in the applied arts, such as a twentieth-century Portuguese [Majolica ceramic](http://majolicasociety.com/majolica-history/) teapot in the shape of a purple and green eggplant—a form of representation different from Asian vegetable-inspired objects, which are usually more refined and abstract. Another example is a leaded glass screen made by the North American company [Louis C. Tiffany and Company](https://www.morsemuseum.org/louis-comfort-tiffany/tiffany-studios) for a transom window at the George Kemp house in New York City. In fashion around 1870–1890, their Art Nouveau designs include elaborate patterns and borrow inspiration from natural elements, as displayed by the transom’s depiction of an eggplant bush with multicolored leaves and deep black fruit.

Avant-garde European painting such as Henri Matisse's _Still Life with Aubergines_ (1911) also reveals the expanding cultural meaning of eggplant and its normalization as a household object. In this painting, the three purple eggplants represent much more than culinary ingredients. "Balanced precariously on a table whose red cloth carries an undulating white pattern that reinforces their tuberous shape,"[^45] they seem to be the visual starting point of a decorative explosion of textures and colors, which spread throughout the interior and beyond, as shown by the mirror, the open back door, and the window with a landscape in the distance. This painting reveals one of Matisse's fundamental themes: the conversion of his own studio into an imaginary space, permeated by _joie de vivre_ ("the joy of life"). In this personal recreation of the garden of paradise, the painter's great admiration for Persian miniatures and Asian art emerge, and eggplants, without losing their domestic character, are reconnected to their origins, beyond the Mediterranean, in the "remote" Middle and Far East.

Decades later, North American photographers further explored the formal properties of the fruit, its shape, color, and texture. Through abstraction and a highly refined sense of composition and light, Edward Weston depicts a dark globular cultivar in _Eggplant_ (1930), the same variety featured in agricultural literature at the time. As in many of Weston's photos, _Eggplant_ unveils the unexpected and the marvelous in natural elements and everyday objects, as well as their resemblance to the human body.[^46] Although the dietary significance of the eggplant is still present, underscored by the white plate, the shiny, ridged vegetable also awakens an aesthetic visual approach, and the urge to actually touch it and feel the smoothness of the skin, the firmness of the flesh.

       fit="contain">
       
This visual and haptic sense is more pronounced in the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, whose creative use of light and formal experimentation is derived from Weston.[^47] Mapplethorpe produced hundreds of nude studies and erotic photographs. Eroticism is, in fact, the guiding thread of his gaze, permeating his portraits of women, men, flowers, and fruit, including a sensuous bunch of grapes and his well-known work, _Eggplant_ (1985). In the latter, a single vegetable lies alone in an unidentified space, whose neutrality is broken by banded light filtered through window blinds. Marked by sun and shade, the meaty eggplant seems to transform into a body or part of one. Its nutritional meaning falls away, and the eggplant can only be consumed as an object of lust in yet another example of its sexualization, and perhaps, its commodification in a hyper-capitalist society. The fruit’s curves and crevices stretch our imagination and resemble the curves and crevices of the equally appealing torso that fills _Thomas (Back)_ (1986), a photo depicting an African American male model whom Mapplethorpe favored and posed in a similar studio setting.

### New Eggplants, Old issues: Bt Brinjal and Globalization
In recent years, eggplant has become the center of one of the hardest fought debates over genetically modified crops. Endorsed by Cornell University,[^48] varieties of Bt brinjal, which were designed by the US agrochemical giant Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) to withstand pests and reduce the need for pesticides, have been made illegal in India and the Philippines, though they are cultivated in Bangladesh. Rhetoric by the US government in favor of Bt brinjal argues for "Huge Yields" and “excited” farmers. On the other hand, activists and research organizations worry about the implications of meddling with ecological heritage and biodiversity. Corporations like Monsanto own 53% of GM plant seeds[^49] and are accused of bio-imperialist efforts to extract maximum profits under the guise of humanitarian concerns.[^50] They also argue that “foreign genes that carry characteristics…not natural to the plant genome” could impact local biodiversity and transfer the agency of local farmers to global corporations.[^51] The idea of a US company not only sending  the eggplant back in an altered form to the regions from which it originated, but also maintaining ownership of the plant is controversial, and this example is key to the kind of issues with which Plant Humanities deals. Plants are more than products up for laboratory improvement and economic exploitation; they have social and cultural meaning. Since plants are at the root of human life, plant cultures weave complex, fluid meanings which are powerful and important, bringing together issues of human welfare, Indigenous ecology, the power of profiteering corporations, and the future of global food. Since its domestication, eggplant has been entwined in human culture, and now, as a global plant, it is squarely located in international conflicts with far-reaching consequences.

In this text, _Tong Yue_ (The Slave's Contract), Wang Bao advises transplanting eggplant seedlings during the spring equinox, advice that still stands for this frost-intolerant plant. His reference corresponds chronologically with the sowing of domesticated eggplant in the alluvial soils of southwestern China.

The text written in 1061 CE is the _Tu Jing Bencao_ or _Bencao Tujing_ (Illustrated Classic of Materia Medica) by Su Song. Wang Jie, the artist of this painting which appears in _Lü Chanyan Bencao_ (The Cliff Walker's Materia Medica), used single-point perspective, adopted from Southern Song landscape painting, to proprotion this eggplant.

One idea is the significance of homophones in Japan. “Eggplant” in Japanese is _nasu_, which sounds like the verbs for “accomplish” or “succeed.”

A key problem with this is that the information needed to introduce GM crops in a way that sustainably helps farmers and ecosystems is very difficult to find, because scientific papers about the plant are too niche to evaluate environmental and humanitarian impact. This paper asserts that "farmers are pleased with the performance of Brinjal," but cites only a photo of a smiling man with a basket of brinjal as proof.
